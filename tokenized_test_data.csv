0,femdot_happy break up song,"It’s 2:27 and I’m playing old records reflecting on misconceptions of what I thought was supposed to happen
A younger me was over capping supposed to be captain
Crashed the boat can’t act like I ain’t know what happened
Crazy how you dealt with the old me
How it took so long to implement all things that you told me and showed me
Consoled me And for you to know me, but only as some one who is broken
And not someone who felt more lonely more times than not
First habit was not open up but bury the lock
Crazy thing I’m gon be with someone doing all the things that you told me to
And someone gonna love you like you deserved to
Be at least, At least we both know it won’t be me at least
You know we tried, well we tried something at least
Even if it fell back on me at least
I know that somebody would be a better man than I could be at least
I mean at times I still wanna hit ya line and check how you doing
But I know that’s not really the right way to do it
Plus you won’t be around for too much long, man you probably gone be moving
To a place to pursue the passions and crafts you been doing
You was always over the city anyway, Anyway
I’m proud of you up in advance, and thank you again
For letting me have you even though I had tweaked again, and let slip through my hands
But then again maybe I didn’t
And this was just the end and the reality is you was built for another man
Maybe in another life we were just friends
Maybe in this life in different circumstance, it could happen again
Look, this ain’t no if you hear this can I get you back song
This ain’t none of that song
This is a thank you for loving me
Even when you were loving too long
This a thank you for helping me find myself song
This is a hope you got peace, hope the pieces of me
Helped you like the pieces of you I had you helped me
Hope you see yourself becoming the woman you wanna be, no thanks to me
I hope no hate for me, not to make me feel any better but you don’t wanna waste that energy on things you don’t need
This a song to say thank you for supporting all my dreams
Sometimes being more excited for things than me for things I would achieve
This is a hope you in your bag song
Reflection on what we had, take the good and the bad song
Wanna let you know that I’m growing now
I pray you with someone who can hold you down everything I put you through I know was wild
But I hope when you think of me, you could at least smile or think that it wasn’t wasted that thing that was on your dial
This is my last song about you cause you ain't pick up the phone
Imma leave this on ya voicemail play all alone
This ain’t no sad song

The happy days of my life is now all gone

2,snoop dogg_my god,"Come on and sit down baby
I'm gonna tell you a story
I want to tell you a story about a man that's been so good to me
And when telling this story
I hope it bless you
Because I want you to sit your kids down, and tell them this story

Back when I was a little boy, you see
My life wasn't always perfect (perfect)
I remember my grandma praying
And she said one day it'll be worth it (worth it)
She said, ""Sit yourself down and listen to me
And let me tell you a little story
This story won't take to long
But I'ma tell you about his glory,""
She said

My God!
Is the man that died for me
My God!
Said he gave me victory
My God!
Will supply your every need
My God!
His love is all I need

I said it happened sixty years ago
When I was washed up in his blood
Saved my soul and he set me free
Now I'm praising the lord above
I never thought that I could change
Until he saved a wretch like me
Now I'm here to tell the story
So that that you will be set free!

Well once upon a time in the Church of God
There was sinners and saints
Evens to odds
Do's and don'ts
Wills and won'ts
The haves to the have-nots
Will be sittin' up front
Gettin' the sermon up close
 the reverend  the offerings
We live in a benevolent lifetime, so stay right

A little boy from Chicago had dreams to be a star
And make a way and get some pay and drive a fancy car
Though his mama used to say to him, “Aye boy just go school”
But whether it was old or new, in school he broke the rules


Now his whole life he told his boys, “Hey y'all I'm going to rap”
So when he got a rap contract, it wasn't no turning back
Now his mama she would say to him, “You need to get get back in school”
And all the trash that the peoples say, he was using that for fuel


And the story goes on and on, it goes on and on and on
They say, “Hey boy, you rap real good, but you ain't making no hit songs”
So he'd tell him self, ""Yo yo yo, self, you gotta do it the way you do
And make this music from your soul and make it fresh and new""


Then the game it started to change, they say music, it ain't the same
Though he remained, the song he sang is, ""Keep your drive stay in your lane""
Inch by inch the people came, they started to know his name and say, ""Do your thang""

Another summer's promise almost gone
And though I heard some wise man say
That every dog will have his day

You know, it didn't go down in flame
There was no final scene, no frozen frame
I just watched it slowly fade away

And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for my time to come around again and
Hope is floating on the breeze
Carrying my soul high up above the ground and
I've been keeping to myself
Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing
Even though you're with somebody else
He'll never love you like I do

I've been biding time with the crows and sparrows
While peacocks prance and strut upon the stage
If finding love is just a dance
Proximity and chance
You will excuse me if I skip the masquerade

And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the dust to settle down along the
Back roads running through the fields
Lying on the outskirts of this lonesome town

And I imagine sunlight in your hair
You're at the county fair
You're holding hands and laughing
And now the ferris-wheel has stopped
You're swinging on the top
Suspended there with him
And he's the darling of the chic
The flavor of the week is melting
Down your pretty summer dress
Baby, what a mess you're making


I've been stumbling through some dark places
Now I'm following the plow
I know I've fallen out of your good graces
It's alright now

And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the summer rain to fall upon the
Wild birds scattering the seeds
Answering the calling of the tide's eternal tune

The phases of the moon
The chambers of the heart
The egg and dart of small gray
Spiders spinning in the dark
In spite of all the times the web is torn apart

And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the time to come around again and
Hope is floating on the breeze
Carrying my soul high up above the ground and

Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said, take me as I am
Cause you might enjoy
Some madness for a while

Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

And love die physically, my love cry miserably
Hugs gettin' looser, her tongue tied kissin' me

From the crack and the snow
On the streets of despair

On his arrogant throne

Are twisted to serve him
And greed has corrupted

With nuclear warheads
And lasers in heaven

That he needn't care
And greed makes a stone of

Blackened with tar

An unwanted highway
Of asphalt and anger
An elegant scar

He mustn't speak

With a one-two punch, B-Real and André drop they verses
Your homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin' clean-up, so it worsens
People and persons on the opposite teams, oh, yes, its curtains
No bullets burpin', oh, just lyrically twerking, oh
Making a statement when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state
It's kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day
Jumpin' the gun and rushing your flow
Babbling on the mikie like auctioneer
Got the public's ears fucked up, can't hear
Atlanta, Georgia where y'all at? (right here)
OutKast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp
Got this thang licked like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps
Making that music that make your neck hurt
And the beats that bother your back in my Cadillac
Six woofers and four amps
Lo pro vogues on swole, with the carriage lamps
Diamond tucked velour pistol in my lap
Come in peace, but then explode like boobie traps

We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed

Had to right my wrongs, the days short, the nights is long
I'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish
From gigantic portions, Lord is important, but I am stronger
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion, divide and conquer
Walk on water, won't be long 'til I'm flyin', that's my departure (Jesus)
I'm a goner
Shoot you down from the sky with eyes of a archer (Ah, yeah)
Better find that thing you die for (Ah, yeah)
(I don't know what I get so high for) (Ah, yeah)
I'm a problem and as hard as I try, no hidin' from karma
You'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes
There was a time...

When I was just a kid
Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high 'cause In my lifetime

Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job?

Take your time
Don't close your eyes
Life happens in a flash
And you don't wanna miss that

Blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big

54,common_a bigger picture called free,"Living in a glass bubble, the fast hustle
The masked struggle that I'm in, the same one that you in
I knew inside when I was outside on the south side
Had to take it a step further the way that Ralph tried
Oh that's my stepfather
He stressed harder to make that bed and lock them doors
For the perfect picture, I forgot to pose
Used to rock Jabos and go out with bros
Tryna get lots of hoes till I got exposed
To a bigger picture called free, in the picture, it was me
Al-Hajj Malik Shabazz, Muhammad, and Noble Drew Ali
A side of Erykah Badu and Andre 3000
Telling me what I can't be
But you can't paint me
Black is the color of my true love spirit and I do love lyrics
And I used to love Harold's Chicken and I dance pretty good
And I feel at home in the hood and I get lit in the club
Still I love

If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom

If you hear this rhyme, it's coming from division 9
The toughest in Cook County
They count me out cause I did a crime
They say it's violent time in human beings
But being they ain't seeing me as human
In this big business called prison, I'm the one that's consuming
Illuminati illuminate me, fume and hate me
Mutilate me from my family, society, and loved ones
I wasn't raised to love guns, well maybe toy ones
My pops, y'all built and destroyed him
With prescriptions of poverty, dope, and unemployment
When will we see enjoyment?
I smile when my little boy get to visit for about 30 minutes
But we ain't never spent Christmas together, tryna get it together
What I'ma do when I get out? I don't know what it is to live out
Just reminiscing of the big house, I'm the one justice chose to spit out
My life story is written in a prison sentence
Wonder if this cell got room for forgiveness?
Still I love

If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom

It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I, it's the realest high
It's the realest high

I said, ""We gotta move smarter""

I hope that you see how they came and they went
They shots never hit, but they made they attempts
May have a good year like that name on the blimp
But you know what it takes to be poppin' this long?
Dedication on another level niggas never seen in they life
Celebratin' all your first downs like they touchdowns bring a price
Young Simba had the bustdown, yeah, the Lion King on ice
Niggas wanted me to look the part, had to stop takin' advice
Put the jewelry to the side, had to find me, had to find God

Smokin' on crushed leaves

Straps over territory they know we must keep
Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean
Back when my mama would interrupt sleep
To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves
Summertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves
My shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys
I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?
Niggas steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas
I'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
It's on Meech like it's trendy
Runnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah
Early twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies
I need plenty

Back when the house that I own now was my home screen
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team
Runnin' missions
Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians
Back when hotlines were still flippin'
Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera
Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla
I always had a little somethin' extra
Back when Corey was our sole investor
And the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya
Look, I ain't no baller
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers
And easin' tensions
Keepin' family out of East Detention
And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center
Spots we got no business enterin'

I had to find a way to get someone's attention

63,nas_the cure,"Too many changes, you changed from your greatness
Become a byproduct of yourself all for the paper regardless
The markets see you as a old-ass artist
The McCartneys live past the Lennons, but Lennon's the hardest
Stay on your path, stay on your craft
They just want you to switch your lanes up so they can hate on your ass
What's in a name? What's in a name? Suffering and pain
Guts, blood, and tears, aim straight, game face, king's grace
I came in this thinkin' you was gon' be this great thing
'Cause I seen the greats do it with a great queen
What these kings have in common? They had women who solid
Malcolm needed Betty, I met some queens who wasn't ready
They envy the unhappiness of the greats
They don't have a fulfilled life yet, so they searchin' for ways
To feel what Sam felt, play the hand Marvin was dealt
A Vandross, here's the cure, the antidote
A thousand milligrams, make sure you don't overdose
Turned to a businessman, used to serve 'em in the cold
Cold game, don't get exposed, stories get told
You glamorize the game, it ain't a glorious road
Rest in peace Kobe and Nip, that's off the rip
King shit, if it ain't about fam, it don't mean shit
The cure, love of the allure
Donuts rotten, the phone tapped, tappin' in with Lord

Roll the credits

Cuban link QB chain belong in the MOMA
So boomerang, you salute my twenty-seven summers
Rolls-Royce Brigade just 'cause it go with the moment
Pac saw the chain, got his medallion, I won't
Insinuate imitation 'cause I copied his stomach
Kings honor kings, straight from my pops to my son's shit
Steak tartare bloody, mercury levels from raw fish
Sushi for lunch, waiter at the table, the cork twist
I'm studied like a book by many
They give me looks of envy, I took the Bentley
White chick like Liz Taylor might get the Bentayga
On my Rick James behavior
Life is school for the soul and I'm in life seven already
Life's simple but heavy, incomprehensible shit
Everything from sexy to deadly, I done been through that shit
Still goin' deeper like I grew a new inch on my dick
We looked at robbin' as a way of resolving our problems
My moms cooked food, but some of my niggas was starving
And whatever they was down to do, I was with 'em regardless
Turns out I was hungry and was hittin' the hardest
Decisions was sharper, my predictions was on it
No fortune teller, just going off regular signs
Niggas often tell ya they moves
Without a word, just reading they mind
Wasn't needin' no nine
Corner executive born in ghetto hell
Where metal yell especially over necklaces
Life lessons is karma
Whatever you dish out come back as blessings or to haunt ya
Could miss your kids and hit your grandkids for your dishonor
That's generational curses, they said they want the old Nas back
Play the Clue tapes for old verses
Messin' my homies' lives up, sayin' Nas will rise 'em up
Like they wasn't live enough, many lives I've touched

Can I get a witness?
I need a witness, drinkin' three at night on some Bridge shit

It's a dub, my love, but I gotta reroute it
It's a lottery, it's loaded, hope I can see all the motives
Before she make a fool out of me, I should know 'cause I'm older
Wasn't meant for me, fuck it, we ain't agree on no subject
We look good together when we was out in the public
You used to brighten my day, had me hype as a kid
First, good morning, good night, now she leave me on read
I'm disappointed, it's different chicks who want it
Can't lie, for a minute, I was sick to my stomach

Beautiful fly girls caught my eye

He was born to be one, that's how my game was won

Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me

Some say hating is confused admiration

Everything is everything, but I still haven't paid my rent
Ugly is ugly, so molly makes them joyful now
When I get down, I'm already up
Molly the water, I keep the drink in the cup

A bullet on my time, my time, fuck it, I'll live forever now

Nobody understands my songs
Aloe vera sentences to heals the scars
Of rental cars to Malibu to Shangri-La

She worry about me, her girl alcoholic
And I can take a trip to L.A
And I can lose myself inside myself
I hope the Lord forgive me now
Why I still be thrifting, accustomed to wearing hand-me-downs
Why my Cinderella a cinder block for my family now
I can't build no mansion on top of these shaggy bones
I left my home I'm on, the road forgive me
There she go again, her dark consumerism
Assimilated in him, cash the new gospel
Occupational sin, just walked out of the church house
With happy all in my pocket, a little something to spend

Honestly I'm just happy I can be here
Hoping I don't offend all my peers
When I say that ass is a mouthful like kujichagulia
Following bright ideas, 'cause I'm a victim to colorism
They flood the prison, no difference hanging from trees
When they gon' leave the system I notice we still ain't free
In this club trying to ban me 'cause my white tee
I mean like high key, I was chosen to fight in a pair of Mikes
Over polite holding a knife
They hold my life in low regards hoping I'm hopeless
But I've been in love for so long like Janet Jackson

Emitting pheromones so I don't got to bear it alone

Grab mittens, who have to spit blizzardous
Actually, flick cigarette ash at bitch niggas
Harassment, eight nickels of hash, delay quick, and then
Dash to Saint Nicholas pad to taste venison
Still in the business of smacking up little rappers with
Racquets you play tennis with, hated for bank lifting and
Spraying then hide away in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and filetted sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up
Tan khakis, an antagonist Dan-dappered up
Ha, vagabond, had it since a Padawan
Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs
Grab a bong, mama and some food, beer, tag along
Get a nice spanking, uh, new Sears catalog
Send them nettled critics to the bezel stop, dead and wrong
Get 'em higher than the pitch of metal tea-kettle songs

Four deep in a Rover cannon
Riding dirty through a Saugus canyon, niggas know that it's the

Pissed as Rick Ross's fifth sip off his sixth lager
Known to sit and wash the sins off at the pitch alter
Hat never backwards like the print off legit manga
Get it? Like a blue pill, make ya stick longer
Or a swift fist off your chin from his wrist-launcher
Chick, chronic thrift shopper, thick like the Knicks roster
Stormed off and came straight back like pigs' posture
Pen? Naw, probably written with some used syringes
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch
Gooey writtens, scoot 'em to a ditch, chewed and booty-scented
Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms
Stupid, thought it up, jot it quick 
Thaw it out, toss it right back like a vodka fifth
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint
Then lob a wad of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit

Posing nigga try to disrespect
Get a fucking thunder to his neck, shout out to Nak
'Cause it's the G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G, G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G

89,billy joel_an innocent man,"Some people stay far away from the door
If there's a chance of it opening up
They hear a voice in the hall outside
And hope that it just passes by
Some people live with the fear of a touch
And the anger of having been a fool
They will not listen to anyone
So nobody tells them a lie

I know you're only protecting yourself
I know you're thinking of somebody else
Someone who hurt you

But I'm not above making up for the love
You've been denying you could ever feel
I'm not above doing anything
To restore your faith if I can
Some people see
Through the eyes of the old
Before they ever get
A look at the young
I'm only willing to hear you cry
Because I am an innocent man

I am an innocent man
Oh, yes I am

Some people say they will never believe
Another promise they hear in the dark
Because they only remember too well
They heard somebody tell them before
Some people sleep all alone every night
Instead of taking a lover to bed
Some people find that it's easier to hate
Then to wait anymore

I know you don't want to hear what I say
I know you're gonna keep turning away
But I've been there

I'm not above going through it again
I'm not above being cool for a while

Some people run from a possible fight
Some people figure they can never win
And although this is a fight I can lose
The accused is an innocent man

I am an innocent man
Oh, yes I am

You know you only hurt yourself out of spite
I guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight
That's your decision

But I'm not below anybody I know
If there's a chance of resurrecting a love
I'm not above going back to the start
To find out where the heartache began
Some people hope for a miracle cure
Some people just accept the world as it is
But I'm not willing to lay down and die

""Ooooooh, you about to get your ass beat""
This sound like niggas complaining when they bitches like Raz-B
B2K in the stereo, we juke in the back seat
Or juke in the basement, in love with my KSWISS

With stars in my pocket, dreaming 'bout making my hood glow
This sound like every place I would go if I could fly
This feel like every summertime
Fall asleep dreaming 'bout all the places I could go
And every one of them feels so close, still chasing time

And I am not a star, I am a meteor
On a crash course towards Earth across the cosmos
Versus Perseus to the father of his birth
To tell the truth—that I'm his real son
Get blocked, I'ma build one
Get blocked, I'ma build two
Hope that you see it's a staircase
Still pray for a fair day
Where they give a fair race to the marinade
And the doggones and the eses and the fair-faced
Keith H. when I peel paint
Rainbows with a pink blue
And a sea foam-type of green hue
Make a clear space
Stop overreacting, it's
Past my curfew, I'm out after 6
Happily making my accident
Mama gon' whoop on that ass again
Pray that I'm making my way before 8
And I might have to sneak in the back again

Hope that she stopping for gas again

Gave that nigga a bible
And I was like ""Yo wherever you go, take this shit with you
You feel me, and you gon' be good
Like I can't, cause you my friend and I can't protect niggas""
Like all I can tell niggas is sit n' pray and that's it
But niggas be taking their life for granted like
You know being on some wild cowboy shit, you can't
You got beef with some nigga like, don't be in their vicinity my nigga…
I feel it

Sometimes I just sit and pray
Sometimes I just sit and pray
Said I don't know why do I live my life this way
Why do I live my life this way
Yo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes
Can testify I'm the best of fly
Live your life and I'm gon' live mine

Tell me what the fuck an angel does
We're seeing kids who ain't aged enough
Getting high off angel dust
From NY to Los Angeles
There ain't no love
In the heart of the city
Looking where they car be at
And they party at
Cardiac arrest can feel risky
Real pissy I chase cheese and real pussy yeah
Cats used to yawn on his rap now look at 'em
Shit ain't been the same since them niggas started booking 'em
Pull up with your pen up, looking sharper than a bulletin
With pin stripes and hollow tip bullets in it
He's something that you'd invest in
Catch him live on late night, but he ain't interestin'
Pop up and poop out something like intestine
No corrections cause the mic been checked in
The only time he be asking is when he sexing
My team like teenage mutants and X-men
Fire spark when I step in
He the human torch
Inhaling fumes of all sorts of course
Steez taught me how to store it in my ball shorts
So when we stop by the D we never get caught
I say it again we face L's but never lost
Either be a warlord for 6 fees short
Each day in this living hell feel remorse
But he had a million dollar smile way before he flossed

Sometimes I just sit and pray

Yo, I'm trying to Oprah win-win with a ""L"" in my hand
Remotely passed off like the generous man
And they wonder what it cost to put the pen in my hand
But don't understand they the only one who gets the benefit, damn
Sometimes I just sit and pray
They couldn't walk this way in my J's
It wouldn't feel despair, but disarray
Like their souls disappear
Son got hot flows, got dropped like disarray
Couldn't close my ghost souls, eyes closed
Covered with Ray-Bans, I call it my eyes closed, and I know!
Even through shades of black
I see brighter days looking back in fact
So I relax my mind, see what these tracks can find
A gold mine that will make me rich in both dimes in mine
Gotta make it all mine if you don't mind
Cause sometimes

Sometimes I just sit and pray
Sometimes I just sit and pray
Said I don't know why do I live my life this way

Lives the vicious ways where they spit and spray
Vicious trey's coming for the ice you kept in yesterday
It's nothing but the history
Protecting ya' from being history
And then the next day your face is just a mystery
For niggas who really ain't feeling me are all my fucking enemies
Even the lightest hours requires heavy artillery
Accelerate without the breaks of a break
And still I'm not eating up to now and there's a lot on my plate
All in a day's work of God and his grace
You wanna eat then tell God and say grace
And avoid the heat getting the boil to surface
A soft nigga caught between these rocks and a hard place
Because the Mafia is on the look out for the Scarface
But the ill-minded child, is ill minded child
Got a round of styles
Killing niggas' mental like a round of shells
Very well rounded, round it well 'til the highest number
Praying that 2047 ain't the highest number

And I don't know why we argue, and I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you I'm sorry, the music makes me dismissive

But I'd be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly, please, palm, no marijuana trees
Your hickeys on my aorta, and tattoos you could only see
When I'm playing surfboarder, put whiskey in that salt water
I emptied every canteen
Just to wear that straight-edge varsity you think's cool
They called me soft in high school, thank God I'm jagged
Forgot you don't like it rough, I mean, he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean, how anal am I gon' be when I'm aiming my gun?
And why's his mug all bloody? That was a three-on-one

Polka dots on my Brit, I'm not supposed to be stunting

Him and dopeman ain't cool no more
'Cause dopeman tried to charge him double for the usual
Damn
You just don't hear good news no more
After I tell this story, I gotta kill who I told
Okay, his new package had came in
Had the whole house stankin'
Traphouse doorbell ringin'
Traphouse gettin' too famous
His traphouse poppin' all night
The porch light should be strobe lights
That shit them police don't like
You know them pigs no good like pork rinds
Gotta go home to that whore wife
That don't never wan' fuck, just start fights
And he just made a hard right at the wrong time
They pulled him over, if they only write him a ticket, he'll be alright
Yeah, right
‘Cause you know he fit the description of a black male that sell white
AK on the backseat
Trunk full of cocaína
He stepped on the gas and got ghost on 'em
His bitch scream like she seen one
He said, “Shut up while I speed up”
She said, “I think you lost 'em,"" now he think he lost 'em
Now he lost his train of thought
The voice in his head said, “All aboard”
And he woke up, don't listen to that bitch
She coked up off of his stuff
And he know it's good
Where the popcorn? This story good, call Hollywood
But anyway, let a nigga get back to it
He came to a neighborhood and he zig-zagged through it
He didn't see the lights, but he still heard the sirens
Cut off all his lights and they drove right by him, woo
Chapter two
Traphouse just got cable
Stuntin' on the neighbors
The cable man was the feds though
A four-year-old was in bed though
He woke up when he heard the Glocks cock
You wouldn't believe what happened ten seconds later
To be continued, dot, dot, dot

Ten seconds left, he gon' get it
Mag in his mouth, mean like a fitted
Caught him in the pool room, two to his head
In the room and boom, they did it, wow
Face on the ground, Ace of Spade on the ground
Run, bullets, they'll chase you around
Don't listen to me, these niggas ain't playin'
Yo, they'll lace 'em down, feel it
One hit Willy
Other nigga live with a milli
Other nigga ride him Phillies
Run through the hood, all blood, blowin' bills on grils
Just chillin' up in New York City
One got witty
Took his mask off, he a dumbass
Got him on viddy
Somebody yelled out, “Yo, that's 'Chelle”
Blaow, blaow, caught her in the titty, huh
Four more shells went to his face like gazelles
Bloody, they laced him up well
Niggas stop shootin', get the loot
Stop bullshittin', boy, you wild, stop playin' yourself
This ain't good, now they fucked
Police barricade the buildin', what?
Now we stuck
Now this clown-ass nigga just fucked us all up (Up)
Eleven more shots
Came to the door was the cops
Chain popped off, caught him in his top
Fell to the floor, damn four-year-old shorty just looked up
Said, “They got you”

Another nigga head licked, damn, they copped out

This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street wit'
Yeah
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street wit'
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah, back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her 'cause see I tried to hit
On the first night, and nah, I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it
And I never called back, how thoughtfulless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist, nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit, my prerogative, nigga
Is to hit and never commit
Not realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call, she was hurting
Now she's staring dead in my face, she was smirking
Like, ""Yeah, I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga
You ain't worth shit, nigga""

Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo, yo

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them, ‘cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light
But they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest
And hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most high
Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anything
Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to
Thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love, it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal, it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace!

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

I'll take my chances
Before they pass
Pass me by, oh, darling
You need to look at the other side

131,kendrick lamar_real,"I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real

I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
You're living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say ""Queen""
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)

I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)

The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like ""because""
Or the word ""but,"" but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse ’cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse ’cause you're the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me ""ball out""?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?

Kenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore. Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie. Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. Real is God, nigga

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah

I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real (cause before you know it, everything's gone)

Alright, that's all I wanted to tell you. Just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom
Boy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin'. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do

But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city...

For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of 13
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
""What the fuck we naming this girl?""
I told her ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects""
I had to interject like:
""Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?""
He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready""
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy 12 years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law""
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you

Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like"" (Stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to You)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, ""It ain't Christ-like""

Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad (Stretch my hands to You)

This resurrected agony there's apathy for caskets
Everything I ever loved I lost in the magic
I claim by the river, my body delivered
When I die there's 27 rappers at my funeral
Moses wrote my name in gold and Kanye did the eulogy
Remember all the bashfulness, understand the truancy
Here I stand in front of a college dropout
My music was a church when your spirit hopped out
Met a gypsy in LA and she reading my palm tree
Mysterious situation like kissing the concrete i.e getting money
I been close to heaven, baby claim he love me
Hold me down forever, I never should have bought this halo
He waiting for me at his table
My funeral a Disney fable 'cause the king 'bout to take me home

Preach, church, tabernacle, Tallahassee sunshine
Southern is my bloodline, we know it'll come time... to go
And though I leave like alumni
I'm lying like a lullaby and quiet like my tongue tied... alone
Bury me in satin, tell the pastors say the sad shit
Same class with the whole... first row
And if ashes turn to ashes then I'm back in my first form
With a dust storm with a corner... and coke
Morbid or late, Lord give Lord take
Viva la muerte, mortal man, less love, more hate
More like mortician, we meet our fate
Funeral home lookin like a home that I used to live in
You wasn't supposed to go so soon I took it for granted
Maybe we'll meet the next life, maybe another planet
Open my soul but then it'll end with an open casket

Uh, ay, tippy-toe on a tightrope
Leaning on green and it gon be a dice roll
I'm fiendin' a feline who mindset Afeni, I got two packs for us
Gold on my gumline done got rich off my tongue
Sticky dro in the tight roll, cleaning my grievances
As a lil' heathen I sat pledge allegiance out
Never believed in y'all system, I needed more
And I done went Figaro with the finger roll
Landed wrong split my head, start leaking songs
And I'm worser than they worst, they make a nigga live forever
Flock with them birds, my heart stay lighter than a feather
It's gon be niggas boomin' at my funeral (oo-woo-woo-woo!)
Tell em play Metro Boomin' at my funeral
St. Louis taught me death could be your neighbor, stay away
Don't take the family for granted, better days await

Goin' finally give a nigga leg room in the whip
From a Civic to a seven must've died and went to heaven
Like a passenger on 9/11, please go find a reverend
You see I promised that I'd never change
But that was way before I made the dough and met the game
Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow
And even white women want a nigga, Othello
I'm balling with nuggets, like fuck it I'm Carmelo
Now the crib got much rooms, Portobello
She drop it low and then she bust moves for the fellow
I sit your ass down like you was playing a cello
See, you niggas hated and I levitated further
Knew I would kill the game, premeditated murder
So if it comes down, may the best man win

I'ma kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm giving life sentences

And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I paid dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggas feel me
Light-skinned it so the house niggas feel me
She catch me creeping out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth for what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke, you would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings cause now all the chicks feeling him

Passed Alyssa house, could've took a different route
Wouldn't be without, think about her every day
Moved on, life fast like that
Still struggle with the past, I'm strapped
Somebody gotta watch my back
Everybody wanna count my bag
Ease off me, these streets taught me
Speak softly, please don't taunt me

Rock you outta space with rhymes, I'm bustin' out

Keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar

You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is
And PS: Your bitch a genius, learned from my penis, I got
Dreams selling arenas and breaking brackets
Tenants racket, while I'm cracking a Serena

I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses

As I crossed the street in my hometown
He came up to me
His eyes all glazed over
His hair slicked back behind his ears
And he said to me
""Son,""
""Son, it's a dangerous world out there""
And ""Don't worry, but if you're not careful you'll hurt yourself""
I said, ""Alright sir, I'll do my best, thank you very much.""
And I carried on crossing
And when I finally reached the other side I went into 7-Eleven
I got today's New York Times and a single cigarette
I also asked them to do me an omelette
But they ran out of eggs
So I bought my things and left the store
With my paper
Lit a cigarette
Flipped to the back pages of the paper to read the sports news
Not much to read
So I got to the curb and got out my keys
The RV was just on the other side
I began to cross
I pushed the button to unlock it
And as I reached for the door

The little homies called and said, ""the enemies done cliqued up""
Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas names on paper, you snitched all summer
Streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress, set trippin’ all around
Ain't nothin' new, but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin'?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, ""What it do?""

Obama say, ""What it do?""
Obama say, ""What it do?""
Obama say, ""What it do?""

I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies

Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y’all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no camera blocking at award shows
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my Vogues
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said ""it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game""

I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo-

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war
Back in the city

When I seen ya, leave me breathless, a-okay, I need a second
Day-to-day, give me attention, I want to take care of you
Marry you, somethin' I'm prepared to do, there can't be two
You was here, I ran from you, scared to take that step
But now that I am ready, you not, you up and left me
Hope your new man make you laugh like I do
I do not mean to worry you with my obsession, I just want to be beside you
I'm too nice, and I had to pay that price
Everything I do is wrong (Wrong,) everything you do is right (Right)

216,common_7 deadly sins,"Gluttony, baby
To me, it's what I see
Gluttony, baby
Is us, it's hard to see
It's knocking
Gluttony, baby
To me, it's what I see
Man, they gon', they gon'
Man they gon' knock this
And ride out to this

It sit deep in my chest, so let me express
Grew up on 868, oh, y’all don’t need the address
It was ‘round CVS, we were so devious
The city never sleeps, it be needing some rest
The streets was a mess, and they still are
Feel our pain, the bigger picture, we was all framed
But the game is the game, so let it begin
In these streets, these are the seven deadly sins
Now, the first is pride, though some call it vanity
A hustler's insanity can break up the family
Pride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change
Knowing that he'll end up in a grave
It's the arrogance, they say, in us Americans
Messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting
Like the second is something we all have
Or felt, than Cain or Khan, it's called wrath
I seen a boss take it out on his staff
Seen a crip take it out on a blood, causing a bath
Never seen a man making money while he mad
So hustle plus wrath? Y'all do the math
Now the third, you probably heard from MOP
They say use them rocks to make 'em envy
Envy, the cousin of jealousy, on the streets it's a felony
When niggas fucking with you but commit infidelity
They hate it, to see you celebrated
Counting my paper, nigga, you could have made it
Let me stay with that thought, takes us to the fourth
Where niggas is lazy, that's what we call sloth
Want you to break em off, getting money it costs
For you to be a boss, ain't no taking off
Now the myth about the fifth: it only happens when we eat
It’s gluttony, this is how it happens on the street
It’s a dude that’s getting paid in full, cars and jewels
So his plate is full, but the way this nigga move
He is never full and he gon' want your food
Don't overdo it, that's an underrated rule
The sixth is a fix that's in all of us
When I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust
When the drawers go down, the guards go down
Cause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now
Okay, the seventh is a seed that many believe
Is the cause of 'em all, this is what we call greed
Knew some cousins that was hustlin', one of em ended up bustin' the other
Greed is a mother, it’s greedy motherfuckers like Madoff
Cops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off
Before I sign off, in the sins we livin'
The good thing is we can be forgiven

232,dead kennedys_stars and stripes of corruption,"Finally got to Washington in the middle of the night
I couldn't wait, I headed straight for the Capitol Mall
My heart began to pound, yahoo, it really exists
The American International Pictures logo
I looked up at that Capitol building, couldn't help but wonder why
I felt like saying ""Hello, old friend""
Walked up the hill to touch it, then I unzipped my pants
And pissed on it when nobody was looking
Like a great eternal Klansman with his two flashing red eyes
Turn around, he's always watching
The Washington Monument pricks the sky
Flags for pubic hair ringed 'round the bottom
The symbols of our heritage lit up proudly in the night
Somehow fits to see the homeless people passed out on the lawn
So this is where it happens, the power games and the bribes
All lobbying for a piece of ass of the stars and stripes of corruption
Makes me feel so ashamed to be an American
When we're too stuck up to learn from our mistakes
Trying to start another Vietnam like fiddling while Rome burns at home
The boss says you're laid off, blame the Japanese
America's back, alright, at the game it plays the worst
Strip mining the world like a slave plantation
No wonder others hate us and the Hitlers we handpick
To bleed their people dry for our evil empire
The drug we're fed to make us like it is God and country with a bang
People we know who should know better
Howl ""America rules, let's go to war!""
Business scams are what's worth dying for
But are the Soviets our worst enemy? We're destroying ourselves instead
Who cares about our civil rights as long as I get paid
The blind me-generation doesn't care if life's a lie
So easily used, so proud to enforce the stars and stripes of corruption
Let's bring it all down
Let's bring It all down
Let's bring it all down
Down, down, down, down, down
Tell me who's the real patriots, the Archie Bunker slobs waving flags
Or the people with the guts to work for some real change?
Rednecks and bombs don't make us strong, we loot the world, yet we can't even feed ourselves
Our real test of strength is caring, not the war toys we sell the world
Just carry on, thankful to be farmed like worms
Old glory for a blanket as you suck on your thumbs
Real freedom scares you 'cause it means responsibility
So you chicken out and threaten me
Saying, ""Love it or leave it,"" I'll get beat up if I criticize it
You say you'll fight to the death to save your useless flag
If you want a banana republic that bad
Why don't you go move to one?
But what can just one of us do
Against all that money and power trying to crush us into roaches?
We won't destroy society in a day
Until we change ourselves first from the inside out
We can start by not lying so much
And treating other people like dirt
It's so easy not to base our lives on how much we can scam
And you know it feels good to lift that monkey off our back
I'm thankful I live in a place where I can say the things I do
Without being taken out and shot
So I'm on guard against the goons trying to take my rights away
We've got to rise above the need for cops and laws
Let kids learn communication instead of schools pushing competition
How about more art and theater instead of sports?
People will always do drugs, let's legalize them, crime drops when the mob can't price them
Budget's in the red, let's tax religion
No one will do it for us, we'll just have to fix ourselves
Honesty ain't all that hard
Just put Rambo back inside your pants
Causing trouble for the system is much more fun
Thank you for the toilet paper, but your flag is meaningless to me
Look around, we're all people, who needs countries anyway?
Our land, I love it too, I think I love it more than you
I care enough to fight the stars and stripes of corruption
Let's bring it all down
Let's bring it all down, let's bring it all down

Love is war, end up on the floor
But baby you only lose when you don't swing back

You fight for a nigga like I fight for you
Like I fight temptations every night for you
And know I slip, only girl in my life is you

260,eminem_believe,"And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill

267,j. cole_change,"My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place

A million pieces lost at sea
Ruined is the crew
That's setting sail with me
Oh Lord we're sinking, God knows we fall
Set sail for Heaven, pray my soul won't get lost
Pray God accepts me, I know I'm wrong
But we've been shipwrecked, since we were born

It was 91st and Langley, we was 6 deep
Stepping up the stairs, black Buick with a slick creep
Moving down the block we had froze (froze)
Felt the tension in my toes “Man who is that? I don't know""
Driving slow, man, he probably throwed
See we was thrown off, it was New Year's Eve
I still remember when my baby lungs blew them trees
I still felt like a saint when I drew that breeze
On the corners was I hanging never banging, but I knew them G's
It's been tragic, since Boy Meets World it's been savage
But the goal was never really the beef, its been cabbage
We kill for it, when we die we can't have it
But we can't kill the habit holding on to this boat 'til we shipwreck

So we swim upon the shore, I die on sand before the dawn
I watch my niggas die afraid what could I fear
They say the waves will wash our sin
That we were black because our skin
I know we gazed upon the promise, but I'm not sure

(Shipwrecked!)
(Shipwrecked!)
Oh, we've got a supernatural love
(Shipwrecked!)
(Shipwrecked!)
Oh, we've got a supernatural love

I been in these waters like the Titanic
Waves crashed down, you'd have thought a nigga drowned, but I’m staring at the sky like, “Why panic?""
Don’t you know who I pray to? We've been looking like prey
I just caught this shit at the prelude, peace
I been keeping it, steppin' to the wolves
Forever a black sheep to the herd
How you not heard about this nigga?
You think you feeling the flow?
It's somewhere in the ceiling, I’m not high
Trust, off the green, a nigga get it like Popeye, (uh!)
I’ve been trying to give 'em what’s good
But don’t call it food for thought; shit taste like a hot fry, (uh!)
Shit had a nigga so thirsty I couldn’t see straight
It was like I was cock-eyed
Fam, tell 'em what you’ve seen on the southside
Tell 'em, tell 'em where you been, nigga
Tell 'em where you’re going
Cole Park whenever I was outside, (uh!)
Somebody shooting nigga, even when it’s snowing
In the cold, you could see the people thirsty
Well, I gotta little water right here, you heard me
All you gotta do is take a sip
And I don’t want your souls, and I do not want your gold
I just do it for the Free my nigga don't trip
Don’t trip, I do it for the free, my nigga, don’t trip

I revolve around the world, a problem solver
Alter your ego, and the way your walkin'
Talk to people, still I stay regal
Read through the bullshit
Sometime to make peace, you need a full clip
Roll dice with niggas who got bricks at a good price
Talk shit, give good advice, rollin' through the 'hood right
It's the good life, like T.I. said
Gettin' it, how could I not be fed
Get bread, get dough, get fed, get mo'

You tried to smoke my ace, you know the stakes
It's high like the ace is
Get your squad face down like cards, before they get a facelift
You get robbed, better yet jacked for diamonds
Leave you nickle-less, like Jack in ""Shining""

274,eminem_session one,"Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
Aw, shit! Yeah
You ready to get this shit started or what?
A'ight, well I brought some friends with me too

Now I ain't back just for the sake of just saying I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
Out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturin'
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin'
Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurrin'
Uh-oh! You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in trouble!
What's occurring befo', after, and during the show
Has no bearing on the bad news I'm bearing, whoa
What is it, wordplay? No, I'm pushing you out the do'
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fucking feet 'til you get to squishing a ho
It's pandemonium, standing o when you see him, oh
Damn baby you look good, you're giving me wood
You should pull over like a sweatshirt with a hood
It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm copping over this game to pinch a loaf
Now, homie, who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words, I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed, came back an hour after the accident
And bit a Goddamn Jawbreaker in half!
So stop faking the funk and start shaking your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap
And Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazing than that?
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?

I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy I'll fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the lining
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69ing
It's like Rick James is shooting up your house, nigga!
Fuck yo' couch, nigga!
You're screaming, ""Fuck the world!"" with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch know I'm perfectly fit for murder
Because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel to O.J. to Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear and ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neumann mad cerebral
You on your last burrito!
(What that mean Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eating
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on fire, nobody touching that
Good day and good night, Ortiz, yo, where the fuck you at?

I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years
Ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at, a nightmare
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art of my nice wear
It's type weird 'cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his ninth beer
Homie, chill, listen, I swear
I'm god, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be? Just waiting to be hooked to IV
As Mumm-Ra's well, when you look at my pee
And this joint (No exception), so just point (A direction)
And record the pig's oink (When I rip his intestines)
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what I exhibit
Seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Edimminem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgusting hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?

I'm right here letting the shotty pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winning
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches
Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flying
We do it to try to do without tryin'

I ain't never been to L.A. anyway, where them freakers stay?
She said, ""Allah, now don't lead me astray""
Everything just look so crazy up here baby

Mom's at the crib performing spiritual Tae Bo
Holy Billy Blanks, let's karate chop and breathe
I'ma prolly start today, having honest conversations
With God, regardless if he give a fuck 'bout what I say
Before you shrug your shoulders, wait, 'cause I know you don't care
I know you thinking, ""Why this nigga feel the need to go there?""
Is it because my nerd eye turned a third eye or eleventh, twelfth?
I guess whatever sounds the best
I bet Lisa Left Eye knew while leaving Best Buy
The camera she purchased would be capturing her last night
What about me? What if I died? Leave the booth tonight
Drunk driver don't even notice my headlights
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn
Just thinkin' about it'd make me shake
And I pray that ain't the case but if occasion turns to fate
Maybe you silly niggas'll listen to what I say
Die and become a legend, a legend is where you stay in the cerebellum of niggas
Steady bumpin' your tape in rotation with Marvin Sapp, Zapp & Roger, Marvin Gaye
Gaze into the eyes of Satan and she told me it's okay
And presented me with the option to talk or just walk away
And I left and ever since she been textin' me every day and it's cool
But Lord protect me when the temperature change
The temptation and palpitation in my heart is insane
I tried to sit and calculate how many ""no's'"" it would take
Before my nose was wide open and I'm all in her face
Yeah I struck out swingin', but I'm all in your base
With ghost man on third, like nobody would play

I promise I ain't make it 'til I'm rakin' in a 100k a month and that ain't nothin'
Half of that stashed into something I ain't touchin'
After that smashed into somethin' I ain't lovin'
After my first meal, ""What you buyin?"", I say, ""Nothin'""
Relocate into the jungle, paradise in the bungalow

My nigga Yoda finally got some ice off in this bitch
Finally, I might even get off this hype of ghetto trip

Tremendously, can't fuck with the mind of a mental fiend
Who dig deep in the depths when he in too deep
I crept on the steps where the demon sleeps
And yell, belch, tell my Lord what he means to me
""Oh, my God, don't be mean to me""
In the ride with a bean or three
And it's not what it seems to be, I can die, I can fly
I can try very easily, I'm a guy and a giant
She's a vivrant thing, I prolly won't buy it
Bird bitch, take flight, no pilot
Serve dick, curve bitch, no bias
Back up, back up, chick, bad timing
I got to get on stage, you better get on page
I have you looking out the windowpane
Or in the rain or anything but in the way
And if I say that's what it is, forget the lip
Now, what's my point, now I forget—damn, this bitch
Got me fuckin' up my script, fuck this shit, I got this shit
Gettin' to the point where everybody say they from the block and shit
With Glocks and shit and poppin', pimpin', trappin', sippin' lean
Y'all niggas fall for anything, you got the plug in Medellín?
Kingpin? You a pen king (Kingpin? You a pen king, ayy)
Bye, bye, niggas, 'N Sync, try I? Nigga, risky
Fire, fire from the wrist piece, niggas shootin' like the '60s

Again, never been shit, never had shit, never knew shit
Never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
Never had shit, I'ma take
Never asking, ""Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, fuck you…""

Uhh, let's go

Yeah… yeah, yeah, what, um
Alright, what you call a chick that don't suck dick? You don't
And if you think you finna come up this, you won't
Down comes the boogie and up jumps the funk
This beat takin' a beating, I hand out the lumps
Damn, baby, yo' ass stand out in pumps
That's outstanding, stand outside until your man come
Or you can leave with the kid, we can plan something
You know I came from the dirt like a sandstorm
Nigga, this a 3 point and-1
And 100, Wilt Chamberlain with the hand dunk
Shawty love JID, let me turn her to a hand puppet
She moan, sound like German or something
Run game, bitches think I'm Todd Gurley or something
Give me a jersey, I done balled so hard, I caught a hernia
Wheeled yo' bitch out my bed in a gurney
You gotta leave lil' mama, the clock's turning
I hit it first, Ray J or Ron Jeremy
They bleed like us so them niggas could never scare me
No niggas got more glow than JID, barely scratchin' the fucking surface
You need work, you need purpose
Everybody good, everybody trap perfect
Everything cool, don't nobody act nervous
Just ignore the fact that your favorite rap nigga is a sap nigga
We don't dap niggas, get the rrrat from the ratchet
Get the pack out the package
Lil' savage ass, ratchet ass, bastard ass, havin' ass
Rappin' ass, jackin' ass, wait
Finna blast, green dot, send the cash, pen and pad
Minivan, been a dad, been with that bullshit, nigga
I don't wake up to the bull like I usually do
Young niggas down the block on the woopty woop
Better pray to God they don't shoot at you

A heritage of vision
Was given to us all
To smell the rose's fragrance
To hear the songbird's call
To watch the distant moonlight fill
The coming of the tides
To understand that life is more
Than always choosing sides
And some have seen what can be seen
Of sailing ships and kings
And some are given feet of clay
And some are given wings
And some must struggle just to breathe
Some have a golden spoon
And some will never leave the nest
While some walk on the moon
And don't you know the life that lives
Within the silent hills
Is just as rich and beautiful
And just as unfulfilled
As man with all his intellect
His reason and his choice
Oh, who's to say the nightingale
Has any less a voice
The silver dolphins twist and dance
And sing to one another
The cosmic ocean knows no bounds
For all that lives are brothers
The whippoorwill, the grizzly bear
The elephant, the whale
All children of the universe
All weavers of the tale
So palomino lie back down
And dream yourself to sleep
The hawk flies with the morning dove
The lion with the sheep
As far away as you may go
We'll never be apart
It's in your dreams that you will know
The seasons of the heart

Blood vessels poppin' out my craniums
Niggas askin' when the tape gon' drop but I got nothin' to say to them
Because I been slacking the skill, although my passion is real
I'm too caught up catching a feel when I should be cashin' a mil
It's something bout me being younger that affected my hunger
Got older in number, realized I can't count on these hundreds
To determine my elation

Dream of rocking crowds, see me filling up arenas
This weed got me laughing like a damn hyena
Yeah, I live a life pretty similar to yours
Used to go to school, hang with friends and play sports
Every single summer taking trips to the shore
And that was all gravy but I knew I wanted more

Still got my training wheels in the garage
But I ain't gonna need those, I'ma go hard (Go hard)

Waiting for the game to wanna let him in, so open up

A closed minded, self-centered social club
Ideas don't matter, it's who you know
If the music's gotten boring, it's because of the people
Who want everyone to sound the same
Who drive the bright people out of our so-called scene
'Til all that's left is just a meaningless fad

Hardcore formulas are dogshit
Change and caring are what's real
Is this a state of mind
Or is it just another label?
The joy and hope of an alternative
Has become its own cliche
A hairstyle's not a lifestyle
Imagine Sid Vicious at 35
Who needs a scene? Scared to love and to feel
Judging everything by loud fast rules appeal
Who played last night? I don't know, I forgot

Others stay home, it's no fun to go out
When the gigs are wrecked by gangs and thugs
When the thugs form bands, look who gets record deals
From New York metal labels looking to scam
Who sign the most racist, queer-bashing bands they can find
To make a buck revving kids up for war

Walk tall, act small
Only as tough as gang approval
Unity is bullshit
When it's under someone's fat boot
Where's the common cause?
Too many factions safely sulk in their shells
""Agree with us on everything or we won't help with anything""
That kind of attitude just makes a split grow wider

It just don't move me, you know?
The music's okay when there's more ideas than solos
Do we really need the attitude too?

Shedding thin skin too quickly
As a fan it disappoints me
Same old stupid sexist lyrics
Or is Satan all you can think of?
Crossover is just another word for lack of ideas
Maybe what we need are more trolls under the bridge
Will the metalheads finally learn something?
Will the punks throw away their education?

All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats

Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner""
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for

The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from

'Cause when niggas start equippin', and throw the clip in
Your blood drippin', and got you slippin'
Another victim, don't know what's hit them—through his spinal
Just another man who defeated by survival
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life
These bars you can't handle you better hold tight
They sayin' I'm the best—I'm like, ""You're so right""
Still ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga

Yo, fuck the police nigga
Fuck every ass-corrupt politician on Wall Street
P.E., Public Enemy, Assassinate us—bitch
Fuck that, fuck everything, son
Fuck government, fuck—listenin' and shit
You want fuckin' energy? Dickheads

It's like 6 milli ways to die my nigga choose one
Doomsday comin' start investin' in a few guns
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps
Better play your cards right, no booster packs
Everybody claim they used to rap
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell em' that the future's back
Riding on hoverboards, wiping out motherboards
Start spitting fire 'cause my motherfuckin' lung is scorched
King Arthur when he swung his sword
A king author I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four
I had a hard time writing lyrics
Now I'm way over heads, science fiction
You can try and get it, I been the flyest with it
Wouldn't mind a feign of interest for your finest interest

Well tell the Based God don't quit his day job

With protons and electrons homie that's an A-bomb
Fuckin' ridiculous
Finger to the president screamin', ""Fuck censorship!""
If Obama got that president election
Then them P.E. boys bout to make an intervention

I wrote this on my born day, it was a warm day
Niggas gotta eat, we gon’ do it gourmet
I’m hearing fuckin’ voices, like when porn play
Stay, stay on your grind like foreplay
What more can I say? Diamonds are for the day
That means to shine, you find a way
Stayed on porches, backyards, and gangways
Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley
Champagne ambitions
I pour it out for my man who made  his transition
Wars about paper, pussy, pride and ego
Born to fly, call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though
Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico
This bra from the DR said I was frío
That’s Ice Cold like Dre, triple three yo
Pinot noir style, better with time
I’m gambling with watches getting better with time
So I’mma ride this out for long as God allow me
They say “time is money”, forever is my salary
I shine tomorrow with what I do today
Yo, get this money, put the diamonds on display

Raw off consignment, God’s in the diamonds
Evolve from the science, power and refinement
Read between the lines, hard to define us
Niggas that’s behind us, throwing up signs to signify us
In the Benz leaning like we biased
I’ve seen Len Bias, that shit scared me
You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never living in the last
My time, man, precious like diamonds
Look through the glass, see what I magnify man
I'mma be shining 'til I die man
I’m a rare diamond that’s hard to find man
Climbing to the mountain top, MLK day
To the streets I speak my piece like an A.K
47 to 87 to the hundreds
Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted
Dreams reflect clarity, ain’t no disparity
Between peace and prosperity, so marry me
Diamonds

Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway
I’m rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day
Way before the ballin’ that was back off in the training days
I used to hit the barber chair and say “I need that fadeaway”
Had a crush on what’s her name, the feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang, banging like an 808
Said you can’t take his chain away
Real player you can’t take this game away

And I just want to say one thing

Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
I don't think y'all heard me
I just wanna say Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
Can y'all dig that?
Now when arrows don't penetrate, see (Cupid grabs the pistol)
Uh, yeah, now, now lookie here
He shoots straight for your heart, now, and he won't miss you
But that's alright, y'all won't believe in me anyway, but

Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs
No, thank you, Easter Bunny
There's all this talk about Santa Claus, but see
Love will rule supreme

Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
You got it, when Cupid knocks at your door (You can't ignore me)
There's no need to run
So, Happy Valentine's Day, hey (Every day the 14th)
Now I may have it all wrong, see
If you know what love means, well
Well, somebody tell me
'Cause they just don't believe in me

Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs
No, thank you, Easter Bunny
There's so much fuss about Santa Claus, but see
Cupid will not be defeated

Happy Valentine's Day, every day the 14th
Now, I know your hearts have grown cold
And that bothers me
Now, I understand, 'cause I used to be a bad boy in my day
I know you tryin' to protect your lil' feelings
But you can't run away
Ho-oh

Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy
Hey, don't you supposed to be
Some kind of player, or something?
Bunny

Well, keep on running, player
'Cause I got my good shoes on
And I got 'em tied up tight
So you gon' find out tonight

Got a sweet lil' darlin' back in my corner
Below, I know I love her, but act like I don't want her
Surrounded by the lovely, but yet, feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor the way I give up my heart
But never know because, shit, I never tell her
Ask me how I'm feeling, I'd holla that it's irrele–
I don't get myself caught up in the Jello jella
And pudding pops, that others opt to call falling in love
But for the record, have you ever rode a horse?
Like for you to send me to Pluto, I said, ""Of course!""
But if you ain't a sweety, indeedy, I won't endorse
Han Solo 'til I'm hit by the bullet, so may the force
Be with you and I'll hit you when better time permits
For now, show me samples, examples why you're the shit
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?
And if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?

It seems that the mind runs wild when you're all alone
The ways that it could be, the ways that it should be
The things I'd do differently if I could to them again
I've always loved springtime, the passing if winter
The green of the new leaves, and life going on
The promise of morning, the long days of summer
And warm nights of loving beneath the night stars
I'm just an old cowboy, from high Colorado
I'm too old to ride anymore, too blind to see
I sleep in the city now, away from my mountains
Away from the cabin we always called home
I dreamed I left there, on an old Palamino
And Whispering Jesse rode right by my side
I longed to hold her, to hear her soft breathing
The touch of her cool hands on my fevered brow
Whispering Jesse
Still rides in the mountain
She still sings in the canyon

""Who can say for sure? Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer. If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use, society would reap a great benefit.""

I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of Tourettes
Fuck, fuck-fuck, can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors' hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up, bitches, with these hedge-trimmin' scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess
And make the best of this situation, I guess
'Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's
Despicable, I'm sick of just gettin' pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a frickin' wuss, a pussy, this kid just took
My stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was 12 and was six foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell; I got back up, all I did was book
Now there's usin' your head, Momma always said—

""If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous"" (I'ma prove you wrong)
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus (I'ma be the bomb)
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Momma always said)
""Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous.""
Guess it pays to be brainless

Fast forward some years later, a teenager; this is fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished
They've stomped me into the mud, gee, for what reason you stumped me?
But how do you get the shit beat out of you, beat down
And be upbeat when you don't have nothing?
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
'Cause you're doomed from the start, it's like you grew up on Jump Street, from jump street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task, practicin' trash-talkin' in a trance
Locked in my room, yeah, but I got some plans, Momma
These damn rhymes are fallin' out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it!
And I'm startin' to blend in more, in school this shit helps for sure
I'm gettin' more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore
I done put a stop to that, threw my first punch—end of story
Still, in my skull’s a vacant empty void, been usin' it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory: in this gourd there's a Ford engine
Door hinge, syringe, an orange, an extension cord, and a ninja sword
Not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored
Ironin' board, a bench, a wrench, a ore winch, an attention whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fuckin' chain
Like an independent store, something's wrong with my
Head, just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I
Don't, 'cause I'd probably be Dahmer, 'cause Momma always said—

""If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous"" (I'ma prove you wrong)

Now my mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
'Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb
I was on the bottom of the pile, gettin' stomped
But somehow I came out on top

I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, y'all, fuck it, I'm out cold, now everywhere I go
They scream out, ""Go!"", I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell-outs, freak the hell out Middle America
Hear 'em yell out in terror, they were so scared, and those kids
Just about belted out whatever spouted
Or fell out my smart aleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate? So be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Motherfuckin' difficult, yeah
'Til then, hopefully you little homos get over your fears and phobias
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers
'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's
A stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You motherfuckin'— insert insult here
Who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ole MC'd
Be able to take the whole culture and reupholster it?
And boy, they did flock; can't believe this little hick locked
This hip-hop shit in his hip pocket, and still the shit got
That white-trash traffic in gridlock, shit hoppin' like six blocks
From a Kid Rock/Insane Clown Posse concert in mid-Oc-
-tober, and God forbid I see a wizard
And get a brain in my titanium cranium, y'all

For biddi-baby spaghetti and teddy bear in my window now
Golden child, always smile
Before you leave, don't look down

Cigarettes over skyfall, writing this like it's my song
Ask me why she hesitated, almost waited, waiting room

Hooked up to morphine, for sure clean like bald heads

Or a model for Maybelline
But fantasies tend to die off when you grow up quickly
Her walls the exact same color as a Tiffany box
Make her waffles, solvin' riddles on her Popsicle stick
If she could, she would leave in a rocket ship
The way she feel got her nervous like a doctor's trip
Mom said she should see a psychologist
Say she love me for my cold-ass raps
Never tell me where the cocaine stashed

I cried as I view it, I'm lyin', I'm goofin', I'm tyin' my nooses
Lightin' my fluids, ignitin' influence, wait
Retire like Ewings, I'm high like I flew in
And my wife lookin' Jewish, wait
My money look Arabic, blunt lookin' Cuban
My eyes look Korean, the coke look Peruvian, wait
She European and she from Aruba, she from the States
Ass overseas, pussy foreign food, we overate
We throw them B's up high as the moon, suwu in space
I come from Mars, but I act like I'm from the Planet of the Apes
Mansion with a gate with some nice landscapes, the Atlantic across the way
Don't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day
Got a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face
And I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face
I cannonballed her face
Fuck her to some Diana Ross and faint
Damn, I lost the faith
Don't judge me, I took the stand and fought the case
You can't avoid the Drac'
Drip Bayless, I'm feelin' Shannon Sharpe today
Big rocks in my mouth, can't remember how many asteroids I ate
Your pastor called today, I told him that your casket on the way
Now pass the phone to bae
I'm bringin' a pole, you dancin' on his grave
He faker than the lashes on his babe, I'm like lashes on a slave
I'm ashin' on his head
He ain't got no credit and his Apple Card is dead
What's in your wallet?

It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is

Uh, look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'ma do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard
And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star
I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous
'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't work out, I hope we can agree on
Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'ma do is free Weezy, go

And I'd take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fightin' the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheesehead, word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the Red Sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recordin', I'm just C-4in'
My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face fallin'
Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin'
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet

You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch
I'm gon' get money, money I'm gon' get
Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit
And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit
That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit
That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream, ""Fuck the world with a long dick!""
Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me!
You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down your entire street
So fly I'ma take off when I leap
Bye! And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
I'm shufflin' the cards, 'bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer

I would like to sit and talk, to see if we could find
The answer to the mystery of love's most precious seed
Is it in a touch or in a kiss or simply in the need
Or is it really love itself that always wants to give
The heart and soul of all of us and everything that lives
Hey there, Mr. Cold, Cold Heart, I know I could be wrong
To think that life could be so sweet and love could be so strong
As to gather everyone of us, like one big family
To share with one another all we have and all we see
It's true the deepest part of us is everywhere the same
And that the only differences are really just the names
We can join the children's song and show them that we care
Let them know we're on their side, no matter when or where
We can free their hearts from fear and hunger reconcile
We can give a child a chance and give a child a smile
True love is still the answer, and we are still the way
The gift is in the giving, and in living what we say
And if you have a lonely heart, this song is just for you
To ask for all that you can give and all that you can do
Remember that the mystery of love's most precious seed
Is in the heart of all of us, true love is all we need
It's in the heart of all of us, true love is all we need
Within the heart of all of us, true love is all we need

You ask me what her name was called
But I found it hard to write
One time I was impaled forlorn
And thrown into a pile
I said you know where I’m coming from
And she looked me in the eye
Loverboy, you drown too quick
You're fading out of sight
Is it the numb density?
Can’t even look her in the eye
Where tiny men have been absorbed
For questioning the sky
To when and where the stars were formed
That glance upon this night
Light-years to sit upon
And paint us as we lie
And to think it's us she's wasted on,
Can't even look her in the eye
See I’ve found a new place to mourn
She asked me who died
Well if there’s a dark uniform
I need a place to hide
As simple as his faith had gone
The burning of the spire
And yet he still searched for warmth
But it was cold by the fire

Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different

Pack a van with four guns at a time

Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck!""

Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat

Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life

Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah

So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide

So I choose to be one with the scum of this earth
Nought is true
So unclean
And it smells so bad
Looked so grand
The thing left at one o'clock
But no, It is awful
And sweat is running down
No, it is awful
And the silesfunder he, “hem l n’a n’a n’a neeeeeeeeeeeeee!”

And he said, ""Come here sweetheart, give me a kiss""
With the thoughts of a sister whom he so dearly missed
Now I understand the reason and feel to comply

Is because that I dream of a woman with the teeth of a raven

A pair of Nike Airs and some fake injections
Somebody let me hold it 'cuz the devil keep testing
Ain't never had no people
Neither a team either
Give a fuck about my sneakers, I was raised in the creek
Where the luxury of weeping ain't available you see
And the factory producing a new junky every week

Tell them girls, ""Keep Up, baby I don't need ya!""
I know it's difficult you had it up to here with those
Flashy ass superficial milky nigga cereals

Wonder what they really on
I'm just tryna sing a spirit song and put my children on

But they don't know they take home

But I, guess I dropped the ball on this one

And my stomach's steady growling, growling

Childish, major moves daily, daily, daily
Daily sprouting, out the fucking box that you tried to lock us down in
But still a nigga quite perturbed (oh well)
But these might be my last words (oh well)
And if you dare to look me in the eye for too long
Guarantee your eyesight gets blurred

But after all the pretty things you'd done for me

And your name was gouged, it was no use
To think that you could play
But despite all the stupid plans you set for me
You're still in that ditch
And I was led here after some talk of atmospheres
I skipped the line, made it known that I was one to see
The desk was pain, said I did not fit

7 years old saw my first porno, damn, that fucked me up
At 10, I bust my first nut on this older ho gut, but so what

I'm living too fast, sinning's a habit
I can't hack, fornicate, act this rabid
One bean short of an acid tablet
Security guards spark my cigarettes
The old head go 'head and cop me a brew
Sometimes them Koreans be cool
These shades make me look 22
They say you learn when you get older
I just say that that ain't true
That just means when you was younger
You ain't get turnt up like us, fool
Just got Ls so I'm riding high, still in high school but I do
Everything I will do, when I'm 25, no lie

I was young with ambition, fucked around with these hoes (Hoes)
Never needed permission, went and lived the life that I chose (Chose)
Premonition-type visions, you see the world as it goes (Goes)
Tell 'em all what they missing, while I watch it as it unfolds
I'm dodging my death, confident kid
I was tryna grow up with the best (Oh, oh)

I coulda been a great graduate
Woulda got one of them hoes from ""The Bachelor""
Could've been smart, could've been a doctor

Falling in love, lucky that I caught ya
Almost got her knocked up, would've been a father
All about energy, make good memories
I'm the fucking Dalai Lama (Ooh!)
Only 18 but I had my own business
Then I got fame like ""what the fuck is this?""
Whole bunch of cameras, fake ass bitches (Yeah, yeah)
Everyone around wanna treat me all different
Oh I'm cool, cause I got money? (All this money)
Back in high school none of these hoes was tryna fuck me (Fuck me)
I thought it was a conspiracy
Sometimes my thoughts start scaring me
You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets

They, they, they been looking for somebody like me
Big bag of weed and a muddy iced tea
Something brand new, wonder what it might be
Coughing off them drugs, moving at a nice speed

Now I'm feelin' worldwide, next stop NY
Next month LA, then back West Side
You change when a friend dies, new man since I lost Kobe
He got out of prison then called my phone like, ""where COMFORTZone?""
And since then I lost touch, but this year I'm gettin' it back
I finally feel like myself, what I've been on, don't even ask
They ask me ""why the Bucket List?""
You know the bucket list, I finally climbed the rock, made it to the top of the precipice
I came from the pessimism of inner city as it is
Accident prone youth, adult say don't take a chance
But we never listen, we went and did it, they vision impaired

Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band

Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches

Whose legs were then spread around the world

No time for dancing, or lovey dovey
I ain't got time for that now

Transmit the message, to the receiver
Hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, a couple of visas
You don't even know my real name
High on a hillside, the trucks are loading
Everything's ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nighttime
I might not ever get home

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco
This ain't no fooling around
This ain't no Mudd Club, or C.B.G.B
I ain't got time for that now

Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit?
Heard about Pittsburgh, P. A.?
You oughta know not to stand by the window
Somebody'll see you up there
I got some groceries, some peanut butter
To last a couple of days
But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones
Ain't got no records to play

Why stay in college? Why go to night school?
Gonna be different this time
Can't write a letter, can't send no postcard
I ain't got no time for that now

Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock
We blended in with the crowd
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines
I know that that ain't allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle so many times now
I don't know what I look like
You make me shiver, I feel so tender
We make a pretty good team
Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving
You ought to get you some sleep
Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks?
They won't help me survive
My chest is aching, burns like a furnace
The burning keeps me alive
Try to stay healthy, physical fitness

Yo, just so you all know what time it is
It's your homeboy
Straight from the A-T...
I ain't even goin say the motherfucking rest
But you know
It's Dungeon Family all day long baby
We finna break it off with some fresh new shit

This rap game lovely
Konkrete play a part cause the Feds want to bug me
Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me
Bending corners in the Benz, ridin like a bucket, nigga fuck it
I know some hoes slutty
I auctioned a bitch off like a nigga playin rugby
I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me
Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions
Perpetrators in the booth, rappin lame like they drug related
It made me sick to my stomach, lost a two and a baby
You don't grind, you be lying
Should be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe?

Tomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

You see, I cock back Glocks, got more pull than slang shots
Hit G spots, I'm givin hoes back shots
I'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops
But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop
Konkrete, Aquemini, we takin this here to the top
Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop
You say it's hot, well let me turn it up another notch
To my real niggas, won't you pump this out your Speakerboxxx
Fuck the cops, we makin noise and we won't stop
Bump, bump, there goes the boom and it's gon' drop
Old school, big shoes, nigga, no socks
We keep tools, see fools, bullets will flock

They call me Mr. Ravioli, Mr. Streudel
Mr. Poke Em with the Noodle, Mr. Cockerspaniel in your Poodle
After school tutor, Roto Rooter, addicted to follies
Like brown collies, stay soft fro crows
Swimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian
Talking a different language, RBI fly wide
Talk to me now, 84 hard, 84 soft wit me now
Beautiful ladies, they want to walk wit me now, talk wit me now
Pussy pop for me now, sell cock for me now
Fight a bitch, hit her in the eye for me now
See you when I see you, now I'm out wit me now

Tomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

I will never fall off, I haul off heavy weight
Fuck wit me dog, I chop you up like Norman Bates
I'm true to this shit, I ain't new to this shit
Over a million sold on strictly weed, bricks
Flammable like gasoline when I'm lit up
I prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut
It's over for you, cavern ass rapper, get out the game
You can fool the record labels but not the streets mayne
I just tell it how I see it nigga, facts is facts
The first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque
I've been to hell and back so nigga give me my props
Konkrete, Big Boi, beatin through your Speakerboxxx, yeah!

Tomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

Ludacris, yeah I keep a Glock in case you like to leak a lot
Meanwhile, crankin' the volume knob up on my Speakerboxxx
So hear ye, ""Get the fuck on the ground!""
Is just a phrase you might hear strolling through the A-Town
They don't believe that we'll stab them in the abdomen
From College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland
So put your fist up boy, you wanna romp
You can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped
Thinking way back before I got mine
Putting bullet holes through the neighborhood stop signs
Still wild is my adrenaline, yes, ladies and gentleman
Denenen, A hundred thou, bitch! Diamonds shimmerin
Catch me with a sack of dro, reaching for The Strap Below
Or with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios
Y'all driving Subarus, stuck in your cubicles
I'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles

Tomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

Fourth and goal, should I take the three point field goal
For the score, or should I roll around and take the ball
Up the middle, the gut, the what, the hole
Cranium overload, overthrowed, now we got seven more
Points on the board, fa sho
B-I-G B-O-I, me oh my, I think He's blessing me
Excelling in harmonious melody, boy we got the recipe
Like Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me
Playa pimp gangsta poet, we gon spit it, we gon show it to yo ass
""You're a champion,"" were my dad's last words before he passed
But I know one day we will once more cross paths
They say, ""Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre?""
I say, ""People, stop the madness cause me and Dre, we okay""
OutKast, Cell Therapy to cell division
We done split it down the middle so you can see both the visions

My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin seed sized mustard seed
Hear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, exalt, glorify, descend upon the earth with swords
And fortify the borders where your shortage lie
I used to hide from God, ducked down in the slums like ""shhh""

I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa, no hog, no meerkat
Hakuna matata by day, but I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages, but never got no hear back
Or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark to gently, gently row my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud, couldn't even let my light shine
But you was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a lifeline
From a lofty height we wage war on the poltergeist with the exalted Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal, it's tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali'll swallow a valley
For every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
O' son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations
With a foot on water and a foot on land?
Who was the angel that rode a Harley
From the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber
And put the true name of the Lord in it?
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Comes like this beast with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scriptures
And gave us the pictures of false messiahs, it was all a lie
Mystery babylon tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown

I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name

Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie

Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar

Fuckin' girls, but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of drugs that enterin' my brain
All of a sudden, every legend keep on mentionin' my name
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same

Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit

At the amusement park, scared of heights, Ferris wheel
Double dare me to kill?

Work four bars that are tighter than your cornrows
See a girl that's lookin' horny in the fourth row

Dontist, manipulatin' phonics, put 'em into sonnets

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (Woo!)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move

My heart ain't never been this full
But my stomach is not so my nigga don't tempt me

This life that we want is only lost in dreams
Am I getting lost in the thought of myself trying wake niggas up like a coffee bean?

We was at Starbucks getting lost in these caramel apple spices

And other solar systems, and other planets of people, and how close our worlds are

It ain't all just about rap no more
My name just like my phone and it buzz so much I don't even text back no more
I done sold so many clothes I don't even gotta pack no more
Just throw it all in one bag
Break it down and roll it all in one joint, take a puff and blow it all in one drag
We gone with the wind, out in Montreal somewhere where your French don't gotta be excused
French inhales with some friends with my quality of life on the fringe, I just see it as a muse
Everybody hurts, I just deal with the abuse, Passion of Christ with my pen to the pad

Can you sell your peace of mind, you're my shooter, you're my fuckin' savior

I wanna follow you straight home so you can finish stressin'
When you need fixing, give me 30 seconds
I’ll cleanse you out until you au corant
Just give me bliss and if we kiss don't get too arrogant

442,sublime_cisco kid,"(Raleigh)
That's chapter 1
Would you like to have chapter 2?
You better, you son of a bitch, I know the way
(Cisco Kid serial)
Here's adventure...
Here's romance...
Here's the famous Robin Hood of the old West...
""Cisco, the sheriff! He's getting closer!""
""This way Pancho, vamanos!""
The Cisco Kid!

Way, way, way, way back in the days, the year, 1980
Had to get a job, had to make some money-ney
Picked up a pen and a pad, dropped reality
Never thinking that I would live to see the day I'd rock my own CD
We used to do the dance we called, ""wubby-wubby""
Now S.T.P. 1993
So Hollywood, get out my way
My mom's word seems like yesterday:
""Love Jesus, don't forget to pray""
She most have gone with the boss D.J., right?
(""Don't be too sure of that, fat one.""
""Fat one?"")
And feelin' love, so skinny-ny-ny
Comin' with the 9 millimeter, point your gun and bullet free (Bang)
'Cause he who has the money, has the authority
And respect to the man with the Uzi
(""Pretty handy with a six gun, myself"")
The 808 kick is on my hit list
And this beat's cooking like an Ital Dish
It wasn't hard for me to do, it was so easy
Because to me, loops looped tight come naturally
Mom's words seemed like yesterday
(Cough)
(""What's your name?""
""Cisco Kid""
""Si, Pancho's name is, Pancho"")

Now in '94, we got an S.T.P
A half pack of smokes, and oh yes, Aunt B
A fifteen pack of Old Milwaukee
A dalmatian and a girlfriend
But I ain't got no money-ney-ney-ney
The 808 is within my reach
Sublime posse come straight from Long Beach
If you think that Hollywood didn't get what he deserved
Call 808, kid, and get served
(How am I gonna get a scar like that eating pussy, man?)
(""There's always some hombre that can't resist swappin' lead just to see if their faster with the six gun than Cisco is""
""He-he-he, those hombres find out Cisco the fastest!""
""Well that don't stop 'em from tryin', Pancho, like Slade, here: he fancies himself as fast on the draw as them quarter-horse takin' after a stray.""
""Oh-ho-ho, that one not gon' beat Cisco, either!""
""Well, what's the matter? Can't the Cisco Kid talk for himself? Is that how you got your reputation, Cisco, by havin' your partner build you up?""
""I make no claim to a reputation, señor, and no one has to talk for me.""
""The Cisco Kid, huh? The kid part of it fits you from the way you act.""
""I've meet with your kind before. (Cat scream)
You're a foolish hombre if you think he will not fight you.""
""You're making big talk for an hombre who will not fight.""
""You are wrong, Slade. I'll fight you any place, any time -- if there is a good reason.""
""Well here's a fistful of reasons!""
""Now, you two quit that.""
""Just as soon as I finish off this Cisco Kid.""
""You are the one that is finished, braggart!""
""Is that a good punch?""
""Alright you two, that's enough! Let him alone, Cisco.""
""I won't forget this, Cisco!""
""I'll take this up with you another time.""
""Any time, hombre. I'd be glad to accommodate you.""
""I'll make it soon, Cisco.""
""Shut up, Cash, keep your mouth shut.""
""That's what I mean, Cisco: you attract trouble like a fiddler attracts a square dance! You understand why I don't want you staying in this town?""

444,eminem_desperation,"Girl, you give me writer's block, I'm at a loss for words
Uhh, my mind's as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours
How much that cost? That's what I call a Roethlissplurge
You drive me bonkers, I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first
Date 'cause I think I gave you power
When I gave you flowers in a vase
A box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs
Probably shoulda never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Shoulda been one of the first signs to cause alert
Man, we jumped in too fast
'Cause since then I just can't be apart from her
'Cause nobody's body's awesomer
I lust her and she loves me 'cause I'm popular
But you know this ain't love

You know this ain't love, oh no (Oh this ain't love)
You know this ain't love (Oh this ain't love), oh no

It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right) (Hey!)
(Wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight) (Hey!)
('Cause I give in at the sight of her)
And I here I go again

You were obviously oblivious to me
I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from
The beginning, now I'm in disbelief, I
Never knew that this could be such misery, ah
'Cause now you see nothing but me
And I don't see nothing but you
And I'm about to flip 'cause we are – super glued in
We stuck to each other's hips and we can't
Do anything individually, which is to cling on
Scared to be alone, can't specifically describe it
I just can't seem to give a reason
That's definitive, just need ya
Talkin' about I live and breathe ya
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically
Addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you
Don't wanna be with you neither
Bitch, put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek
'Cause this ain't love

You know this ain't love, oh no (Oh this ain't love)
You know this ain't love (Oh this ain't love), oh no
What is it then?
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right) (Hey!)
(Wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight) (Hey!)
('Cause I give in at the sight of her)
And I here I go again

Just want you to myself
Don't wanna share you with no one else
""What the fuck you whisperin' for?
You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the
Games behind, your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
I think you need to finish developing a
Little more mentally to get the picture.""
That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the keys up
To the crib ever again, no Visa
Not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut
Guess what? (What?) The lease up
I'm just mad the time it took to discover
You were usin' me for loot like I used you for looks
Oh, thought you was too good for me, huh?
Yeah, toots, used to be my Carrie Underwood
I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leavin' you, I'm not comin' back
She said, ""The fuck with that!
Where's my Louisville Slugger at?""
She grabbed that fuckin' bat
And swung it at my head, I barely ducked and that's
Right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, girl probably coulda put a 100-yard field goal
Through the uprights

You know this ain't love, oh no (Oh this ain't love)
You know this ain't love (Oh this ain't love), oh no
What is it then?
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right) (Hey!)

Throw them off the roof neck first

Only black man that Fox love is in jail or a dead one

Married to the game, but she broke her vows

I don't reach, so she can't get in touch with me
Can't be buds with me

For every single ex, I want the best
I really wish you nothing but success

Doesn't it get dark, right before the sun peeks
And bears his face? And doesn't it get so hard to breathe?
But it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out

When no one says they're wrong, or sets the record straight

But it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out
That shit might hurt now, but I'm with her now
Don't need closure now, just keep the shirt now
Sorry you were led to believe
Bunch of different stories that was never to be
No you isn't ugly I just said it to be
Funny we both know that you look better than me
Sorry I started runnin' when you ran into me

That I'm dwarfin' all competitors

It's psychological warfare, endorphins I effect
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blastin' out your deck
She loves me, such passion, you'd expect
This sort of reaction from her, yet you strong-arm
You're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop the Don Juan
But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, ""C'mon, son!""
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like, ""She's fuckin' with dude, she wants some""
Homeboy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick 'cause I spit better than you

I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet: a star
And I'm not about to sit back
And just keep rhymin' one syllable — naw!
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough, but I'm not givin' up
'Til I get my respect and I won't stop 'til I get enough
'Cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations (Aww!)
That hater alarm is soundin' off
And Obama took the bomb from my name (Aww!)
So quit cryin' that I took your dame, homie, she's my dame (Aww!)

And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth

With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryin' to relax
Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon
I got a army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan
Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on
I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't stayin' long
What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?
I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen
Said I'll make it big when everybody know me
Well, I made it big and everybody phony, ha
So could you pour me? I need a cup
No, none of that liquor, mix in purple stuff
I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much?
Go 'head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free

But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though
Potion in my Sprite, then my night slows... down, down (Aha)
See, that's exactly what I need

This whole fuckin' game thankless
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from

They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me

I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since ""No Scrubs"" and ""No Pigeons""
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
""Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike""
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down

Take that, take that
No love in they heart so they fake that

""When can I get a favor?"" or, ""Where my bitch at?""
Like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari

And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me, I'm a sensei
And I got fat pockets, you niggas in shape

490,chance the rapper_family,"Turn the radio up and we can have a good time
Got me feeling like J.J. on Good Times
Back when Thelma had that ass, off the fam good
My sister said she likes my raps 'cause it sounds good
Told me not to cut corners, use to cut quarters
Sitting in the room, on the phone, cooking up orders
'Til my pops popped me off, that was family matters
Used to watch him in the kitchen sipping Sammy Adams
Now I'm rollin', iPhone Stolen
Mama whip with 5 of my guys, 4 holdin'
Trying to live our lives like our lives are so golden
Got big shoes to fill like try go an' bowling
'Til we strike out, we just hoping we don't strike out
4th quarter, how you gon go and take Mike out?
Summertime Chi, I had to pull the bike out
Riding, getting nice 'cause it's nice out

Shore you got drive, don't turn fake on they ass
Good morning, good raps, good morrow, good luck
Tonight you could blow, tomorrow you suck
Bizarro, my carro, I borrowed from Chuck
A new SLR and Ferraro deluxe
No money for the meter when I'm parkin' 'em
Gassed than a bitch no car with him
Market him, tell him that he's buzzing like a game of Operation with Parkinson's
Young kid rappers, kidnapper
Young whippersnappers that will whip past ya
Will get at you, come get at you
Wanna break ya off, come Kit-Kat you

Didn't know the name before bet you niggas know it now
Chi-City niggy, made a 50 out a penny
Got some titties at the cribby and the Savemoney with me and we going in
Going all out for them hoes again
Now I'm fin' to bring the fucking flow and bend it back
And show it's more to this than rap
Love my parents for supporting 'cause they know I'm finna crack
Know my niggas got my back, got some niggas selling packs
But I'm tryin' to get 'em cheese so I can get 'em out the trap

Shottin' hoops with Charlie Mo and 
With the bumblebees, real east-side G's
Then go to  and ball out for any black ass
And wait for all the bitches at Poly to get outta class

But not no guillotine see, we be them Southern playas
Remember the football socks, aerobic Reeboks and Decaturs, now
You up to par and ready for your lesson
I got an ounce of dank and a couple of drinks so let's crank up a session
Like Tri-Cities High School, was pulling 'em in a broke down Rabbit
I spit a couple of words and laying em down was just a habit
Just like Smokey, choking off da pee-wee that we rolled up
Talking about the clique will get you nathaniel but swolled up
Hootie Hoo slapped you boys across the cheek with Isotoners
And went to tell yo momma and yo pop that you was a goner
Tell 'em Big Boi did it; I swear that nigga be rhyming
Every lyric that he spit be turning charcoals into Diamonds and Pearls
Girl, when you giving up them drawers, 'cause
I got a couple of niggas down the hall
That wanna hit it too, I'm not the type to be acting selfish
Set it out and let it out and I'll be right back just like Elvis
'Cause the postman rings twice...

Record companies act like pimps
Getting paid off what we made when we the ones that's fly like blimps
But ain't no Goodyear, I tell it like it is so I'm like look here
Just willing to get what I deserve, my kids do have a mother
And a little house, with a dog in the backyard going ""woof-woof""
Who knows what I must face when I leave this recording booth?
Poof, back in the real world where birds fly
From Miami by way of Cuba to whoever wants to get that high
There's clouds of clowns, seas of G's
Pro-jects, packed with playas meditating on their knees
Just to make them ends meet, like ground beef, you won't believe
The shit that niggas attempt 'cause they got other mouths to feed
Besides they own

Now you don't have to try so hard
The label says you don't have to wear less clothes
It's time to take a bubble bath

Hey, hey little baby, breakdown
Button up baby, you come undone
Hey, hey little baby, get down

You say you need privacy

Like Miss Monroe your head don't know
Exactly what your body's doing

Hey, hey little baby, breakdown

On TV you're soft and whispery
Delicate like angel food cake
They say if you press too hard on it
It will squish into a dense ball
It will lose its fluffiness
That's what you get when you use a box mix
Can you get some satisfaction
How much are you willing to pay?

Hey, hey little baby, breakdown

Pop some, ops run
This ain't a game nigga, ain't no options
Nigga selling on the block like an auction
Dig into my pockets, see a profit
Where the money and the bitches is where the guys is

Made for the life, fall out like we out of bounds

Tripping like you from out of town
The four pound will leave you on the ground without a sound

Fake ass gangster, quick to take a fag's cash
Five versus six, Star Wars
No stickers, real bullet holes in car doors
Out of ten people that was shot, 7 ate 9's
Two trey 8's, and one 45
Tryna get to 23, numbers game
Then here come the fame
But they won't say no names
Are these celebrities way too shy to be loyal to the town
I take my publishing check and spread my royalties around
Popes, bishops, disciples, stones
Counts, princes, lords, queens, and kings
They drilling on my land but ain't no oil to be found
I might be part of the problem
I guess they just tryna prove they can back that shit up

This country is too divided, too disillusioned
To ever come together around a common purpose. They said

(""Although it seems heaven-sent

They forgot us on the block, got us in the box
Solitary confinement: how violent are these cops?
They need a early retirement
How many rallies will I watch? I ain't got it in me to march
I got a Semi to spark, the game's in a drought
Public housing, projects, cooking up in the Pyrex
My set, my clique, either getting money
Or running from homicide trial, that's if they ain't died yet
Trying to be rich, still I'm pledging allegiance
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader
Lending my poetical genius, to whoever may need it
I bleed this from Queensbridge, now living with my feet up
Never defeated, so a president's needed
You know these colored folks and Negros hate to see
One of their own succeeding
America: surprise us and let a black man guide us, uhh

Loading up mine too, ready to ride
'Cause I'm riding with my crew - he dies, we die too
Yeah, but on the positive side
I think Obama provides hope and challenges minds
Of all races and colors to erase the hate
And try to love one another, so many political snakes
We in need of a break, I'm thinking I can trust this brother

Every innocent nigga in jail gets out on appeal

Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish? I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever

But maybe I just use too much

Think I will run to you

What we like to do right here—well first of all, let me let you know who I am
Well, I go by the name of André 3000, right?
And we come from a little place called like Stankonia, Georgia, right?
You know, right now everybody wants to be from space
And like want to be from the country and everything like that
You know, like, really, like, the South
It's like cool to be from the South right about now
Girls, listen up

Torn between Saturday night and early Sunday morn'
I don't know, I'm somewhere stuck in between-tween
I'm out here knowin' hip-hop is dead
The average nigga on my corner yellin'

Counterclockwise goes the neighborhood
Hand-me-downs and canned goods
Won't cut the Grey Poupon
We got to make you run, back to the drawing board
Can't afford to lose, y'all make me yawn
1/1/91... my teacher sees potential in me, said, ""Sit down, son""
And let me tell you like I heard it when I felt deserted
It wasn't no other way to word it, got my feelings murdered
By the bullet of bad, the singer of sad
Songs to make you long for your mom and your dad
Plaid clash with polka dots, I hope you ain't mad
Back up, little mama, I'm about to react

Yup, we ain't just funkin' around, ah-ah
No, you don't want to see me clown, ah-ah
No, tomorrow sounds like right now, ah-ah

It's time to bounce, rock, roller-skate

Silence before violence
Nine times out of ten times, the quietest is the livest

Ooh! Your Southern drawl got me sprawled out

Does it carry lots of grown-up folks and little kids inside?
Is it bigger than our house? Well, how can I explain
When my little boy and girl ask me ""Daddy what's a train?""

When I was just a boy and living by the track
Us kids would gather up the coal in big old gunnysacks
Then we heard the warning sound as the train pulled into view
The engineer would smile and wave as she went rolling through
She blew so loud and clear, we had to cover up our ears
And we counted cars just as high as we could go
I can almost hear the steam, those big old drivers scream
Sounds my little kids will never know

I guess the times have changed, kids are different now
Cause some don't even seem to know that milk comes from a cow
My little boy can tell the names of all the baseball stars
I remember how I memorized the names on railroad cars
The Wabash and the TP, Lackawanna, the IC
The Nickel Plate and the good old Santa Fe
Just names out of the past, I guess they're fading fast
Every time I hear my little boy say

Daddy what's a train? Is it something I can ride?
Does it carry lots of grown-up folks and little kids inside?
Is it bigger than our house? Well, how can I explain
When my little boy and girl ask me ""Daddy what's a train?""

We climbed into the car, drove down into town
Right up to the depot house, but no one was around
We searched the yard together for something I could show
But I knew there hadn't been a train for a dozen years or so
All the things I did when I was just a kid
How far away those memories appear
I guess it's plain to see they still mean a lot to me
Because my ambition was to be an engineer

550,eminem_baby,"One thousand different houses and Münchausen, I'ma make you
Wanna punch out some-fuckin'-one: ""Ouch! What the fuck you hit me for?!""
Screamed life as I punch counter, in bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger in a dumb gown
Black hoodie with a scythe, shit, I laughed in his face, spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like, ""Take this!
Now get your ass back in that game, bitch! Don't take shit
For granted, and don't take shit, give it!""
Only bull you should take is by the horns, a mixture of Whitey Ford
And Mighty Thor, I everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writin', then record, replenish, keep writin' more
Nothing's ridin' on it but your pride, that's all you're fightin' for
So you fight, scratch, you claw, backs to wall, no one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls like they're gargantuan and ask yourself how fuckin' bad you want it
Pull out your badge for whoopin' ass and flash it on 'em
Nobody's gonna back you in the corner, you're a hornet
No one's more ignorant than you fuckin' four in the mornin'
You're at the laboratory, stormin' like there's nothin' that's more important
Emcees, you better consider this a formal warnin', you're in for it!
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face?
I ain't finished, bitch, I meant ""in half"", oil the blades
Nobody wants to play, they say I'm a spoiled lil' baby, but—

Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya

What goes through an addict's brain besides static pain
And Big Daddy Kane, breakbeats and words? An erratic train
Of thought like splatter paint, scatter brain
Yeah, maybe that explains why you're back but don't rap the same (Yeah!)
And you're lookin' way thinner 'cause your hunger got you lookin' like
They took away dinner (Chicka) ""Sugar Ray"" Leonard
Wouldn't sugar-coat a fuckin' booger though just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a (Chicka) what? (Chicka) GOAT
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips, hope it lands on
Another rap singer's lips who can't think of shit anything of wit
That's interesting to spit, yo, who's king of this fuckin' English lit?
Let your middle fingers flip on each hand while extendin' the shit
How low can you go? Lower than Chuck D, ho
Hear the bassiness in my voice? Rocky's back, where my Adrian's?
Nobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the Patriots
To rap; I'm not a man, I'm a weapon who just happened
To be a rapper who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany in the bathroom
I'd never be the same after now I'm back with an appe-
-tite for destruction and a fuckin' recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished, every deed is a dastardly
One, evilest bastard, even you askin' for me to be po-
-lite to people's like me havin' my teeth pulled

So step inside a dimension demented side of a mind that's like
An inside of an engine while I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded: if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper you'll be the first one who finds him offensive
Got him climbin' the fences, lost some time to addiction
But look up ""rhyme"" in the dictio-nary, I'm in the picture
""Eminem"" is the synonym for it, I'm an enigma
Fuck it, let's get to the meatballs, I'm gonna skip the
Veg and potatoes, edumacator (They are)
Shit, legends are made of, spit treacherous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretched is what you get when you mix Treach with a Jada

In pajamas, standin' in front of a webcam
Beatin' themselves in the head 'til Russell lets him off Def Jam

Hangin' from his ceiling, drippin' with a bed pan

Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

From what the world may see

Shadows moving on the sand
Somebody whispering the twenty-third psalm
Dusty rifle in his trembling hands
Somebody trying just to stay alive
He got promises to keep
Over the ocean in America
Far away and fast asleep

Silent stars blinking in the blackness of an endless sky
Cold silver satellites, ghostly caravans passing by
Galaxies unfolding, new worlds being born
Pilgrims and prodigals creeping toward the dawn

And it's a long road out of Eden

Music blasting from an SUV
On a bright and sunny day
Rolling down the interstate
In the good old USA
Having lunch at the petroleum club
Smoking fine cigars and swapping lives
He said, ""Give me another slice of that barbecued brisket!""
""Give me another piece of that pecan pie!""

Freeways flickering, cell phones chiming a tune
We're riding to utopia, road map says we'll be arriving soon
Captains of the old order clinging to the reins
Assuring us these aches inside are only growing pains

But it's a long road out of Eden

Back home I was so certain
The path was very clear
But now I have to wonder
What are we doing here?
I'm not counting on tomorrow
And I can't tell wrong from right
But I'd give anything to be there in your arms tonight


Weaving down the American highway
Through the litter and the wreckage and the cultural junk
Bloated with entitlement, loaded on propaganda
And now we're driving dazed and drunk
Been down the road to Damascus
The road to Mandalay
Met the ghost of Caesar on the Appian way

""But the road to empire is a bloody stupid waste""

And I'd cry and I'd scream, ""Baby, please don't leave!""
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze
And you'd laugh, and you'd tease
You're just fucking with me, and you must hate me
Why do you date me, if you say I make you sad
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge

Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
Nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
‘Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
It's like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!
‘Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left
And left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we coulda been

Pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
I'm gettin' up once and for all—fuck this shit!

And I thank you, ‘cause you made me
A better person than I was
But I hate you, ‘cause you drained me
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me, you're crazy
And after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone

Same time my man is murdered; the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name

Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

I used to print out Nas' raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read them in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'd a thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though ‘cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, ""You the one, yo, why you make that shit?""

I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made ""You Owe Me""
Dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par
When I followed my heart
Granted, my heart was tainted
By my mind that kept on sayin'
""Where's the hits?"" You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcome
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, study they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game

But on the way I let Nas down
I got no one to blame
I'm ashamed, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you can never understand, fuck it

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core
Then I can open the door
Reintroduce them to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross
Dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose
I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it
How could you fail to respect it?

Letting Nas down, I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it

Ayy, higher
Ahhhhhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh

Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy

Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

Yeah, uh
Yeah

This is legendary
Always been my mission, never secondary
Gettin' better every January, it's very scary
They gon' recognize eventually, I take it if they don't give it to me
Swear all of it was written for me (yep, yep)
By a higher conscious spiritually (up, up)
Up and away, jump on a plane, get on my wave right now
I want you believe not only in me, but have some faith in yourself
I wish you peace and good health, happiness and some wealth
I threw a coin in the well, 'cause I was feelin' so well
A token of how I felt, never heard if it fell
Not a noise, not a sound, still no reason to doubt
Quality what I sell, quantity in the sales
Quantum physics myself, count a million atoms of cells
This life I'm livin' it out, damn right, my vision is now
Don't let the prisoner cell build a strut to break out
My brothers at the brick house, the undercovers stakeout
Can't you see it's a trap? The type of shit I think 'bout
I sensed they needed my help, that's why I had to reach out
What you think I do it for? My brothers under a spell
It's clear we livin' in hell, the life of a black male
Right out the womb, you come out, and it's a bunch of blackmail
Just waitin' for you to fail, a special room in the jail
With your name, a number on it so you property now
I see it properly now, it's what the poverty 'bout
It's all a game of Monopoly, tryna cop me a house
An elephant in the room until I fit in my tomb
And introduced to my doom, they say the end comin' soon

Legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in the sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light
They say the legends, they never die

'Cause they won't ever kill the light

Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside of my soul
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside my control

Look, ready for whatever comes
I hope for the best, I taste the peace and pray it never leave my tongue
But yet, before long, the feelings done
Perhaps I was foolish, just like the boy that prays to only see the sun
Maybe, life happens like tides
One minute you're low and feelin' shallow, then all of a sudden you rise
Just, ride the wave, I say to myself
Find a way, the weight of my wealth
It's honestly a lot to bear
I play the game of stackin' knowin' that I ought to share
How much does a man need? How much can he hoard before his greed?
How can a rich father teach humbleness to his seed?
Just questions, the stubborn all get taught tough lessons
I look at all I got like, ""What's missin'?""
God is my only guess, 'cause yes, faith relieve the stress
I find peace again when I find Him and see I'm blessed
Real blessed, life has always got me wonderin'
(Wondering, wondering) Am I doin' it right?
Am I hurtin' myself?
Am I wrongin' the ones that love me the most?
What a burden to have
That ain't no way to live
Or maybe it is
Well, maybe it is

Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside of my soul
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside my control

When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, ‘cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it 'cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of letting my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame ‘cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowing through our veins is the same
My mama left you and it may be that anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be telling you “fuck you” ‘cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help but...

Cases in court, fam' showing love and support
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
If love is a place I'ma go again
At least now, now I know to go within
At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then you're home again
I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he don't want to end, yo

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

It's all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love, hoping it'd become one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide, some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Trying to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave
Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave
Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?
Everybody loves sun, why do I attract shade?
Heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
What it is to be loved by a man

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

Some say that I'm a dreamer 'cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
We walk and stand in, fall in it
With the right companion we all in it
Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits
In the game of life, it's the scrimmage
Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people, love always, yeah

Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers'? It's a rare condition
It's what you're sufferin' from when you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no frickin' air conditionin'
And you can't see the bitch’s hair is frizzin'
'Cause you got the windows up, blarin' the system
In your Chevrolet Prizm
The devil ain't on a level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him givin' an adjective an ass-whoopin'
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs
Like they did somethin' to me personally
Used to get bullied, so I'd cut class and ditch it
Now I bully rap, I'm the shit, f*ggot (Sniff it!)
Cadillac from a K Car
My ass from a hole in the ground, still can’t tell 'em a-part
Came straight out the trailer park
Screamin', ""I'm proud to shop at K-Mart,"" and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart, arguin' over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin', I don't give a fuck, I don't play
Bitch, you think you saw this basket first?
You're ass backwards like motherfuckin' Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
Ripped a gapin' hole in it, flipped out
Ripped down the drapes, tied 'em around my neck
Went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground
Splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell, got impaled by the gates
Saw Satan, stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sashayed around flames with a match
And I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothin' to do with a scale
Or being gay, little faggot, but by the way
Thoughts are gettin' darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey
Tyler the Creator, and Violent J
It's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face
I'm insane, every rhyme I say
Sons you like an ultra-violet ray
I’m sellin' hatred, buffet style, all the shit you can eat
$11.99, so come on and pile a plate!
I’m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I’m spittin' while I’m shittin' on competition
In the meantime it’s always mean time, I'm gettin'—

I'm getting by with my wicked ways

I wanna dig my way to hell

I’ve been a career asshole
I don’t see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit
I was born a mistake, but I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose
Was to beat a beat purplish, slaughter tracks
I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
I’m comin' to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong, the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
'Cause that cougar's a MILF
She's the oldest trick in the book, but I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'ma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion, my suggestion’s Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm runnin' away with the game
It's 'cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by with my wicked ways
Lady, you can suck a dick 'til your neck aches
Cry 'til you get puffy eyes, red faced
But I'm leavin' on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
And I'm sick of poundin' a square peg in a round hole
Sorry, another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gon' fit in my storage overhead space
'Cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words: don't try to put your heart in a headcase
'Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't
I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me, I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines
And see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind, you can see my pain
And you'd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee-high playin' with G.I. Joes
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game
'Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Like a fuckin' (fuckin') echo (echo)
(Psych) Psycho on a cyclone cycle, spiralin', here I go
I'm outta control like no other mic go
Stab you 'til the knife goes – dull
I'm nothin' but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
'Cause I'ma sock it to you!
Dyke ho, you don't like it?
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night, so
Strike up the fuckin' maestro, I'm nitro
And hi, ho, hand me my shovel!
I'm liable to dig my hole deeper
And it's off to H-E double hockey sticks, I go

Machines can do a better job than you

And sweep you under the rug

It costs too much to bury all the dead
The mutilated disease-injected
Surplus rats who can't be used anymore

Ground into sludge and flushed away

So I guess this is what it is, huh?
Think it's obvious
We ain't never gonna see eye to eye
But it's funny
As much as I hate you
I need you
This is music to be murdered by

Got a premonition
I feel the end is near
The beauty starts to fade
The joy has turned to pain
I hear the symphony playin'
Ten thousand violins
Souls floating away like feathers in the wind

They said my last album I sounded bitter
No, I sound like a spitter
Who ninety percent of
These hypocrites are tryna get rid of
But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?
I was considered, one time, as the illest
Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper
True, I just get richer
But if it was ever all about skrilla
Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago
Bitch, shut the fuck up
I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or to Jigga
Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit
No wonder you're mad, now I'm
Looking at them plaques, count 'em (Yeah)
I'm LL Cool J, Bigger and Deffer, that's how come (Uh)
I sell like four mil' when I put out a bad album (What?)
Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em
But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta
Five, and I'll laugh out loud
'Cause that's what they gave BAD back in the day
Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause
If it happened to James
It can happen to Shady
They do the same shit to Brady
More people hate me than love me
This game will make you go crazy
'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E
I was the G, the O-A-T
Once I was played in rotation
At every radio station
They said I'm lyrically amazing
But I have nothing to say
But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say
They said that they hated the awake me
I lose the rage, I'm too tame
I get it back, they say I'm too angry
I need to get me some Dre beats
No, I should hook up with Tay Keith
Fans keep on pulling me one way
Haters pull me in another
Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee
'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches
They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby
I dish it out but can't take it
But I take it, dish it back out
And they get all bent out of shape
This shit's almost comical
Wait, and I meant no disrespect
I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z
They probably feel the same way because lately
Instead of us being credited for longevity
And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we
Get told we'll never be what we were

I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be

Start chasing dimes and petty crimes

607,john denver_marvelous toy,"When I was just a wee little boy, full of health and joy
One Christmas morning I received The Marvellous Little Toy
A wonder to behold it was with many colours bright
And the moment I laid eyes on it, it became my heart's delight
It went zip when it moved and bop when it stopped whirrrrr when it stood still
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will
The first time that I picked it up I had a big surprise
For right on it's bottom were two big buttons that looked like big green eyes
I first pushed one and then the other, then I twisted its lid
And when I set it down again, this is what it did
It went zip when it moved and bop when it stopped whirrrrr when it stood still
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will
It first marched left and then marched right, then marched under a chair
And when I looked where it had gone it wasn't even there
I started to cry but my Daddy laughed 'cause he knew that I would find
When I turned around my marvellous toy would be chugging from behind
It went zip when it moved and bop when it stopped and whirrrrr when it stood still
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will
The years have gone by too quickly it seems, I have my own little boy
And yesterday I gave to him my marvellous little toy
His eyes nearly popped right out of his head and he gave a squeal of glee...
Neither one of us knows just what it is but he loves it just like me
It still goes zip when it moves and bop when it stops, whirrrrr when it stands still

Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees
Look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not
I mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here, it's easier to find a gun
Than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position

Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I got the hookers on the go and playa rhymes that I fuck with
And bury amps that pops my trunk swift
I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk
Do how them hustlers do
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
Always claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And make my money 'cause my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
Ain't nothing wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that
But you ain't know I'm the one dipping and dodging bullets
The price you pay when you behind it steady trying to pull it
So Dolemite, Dolemite not shit
I studied The Mack and Rudy Ray Moore
They were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head, greasy face, eating watermelon
To drug dealer, armed robber, now convicted felon

Our heavenly Father, why do you even bother watching over me?

A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten
This ain't no secret garden, so you flower niggas flee
If it is one of my own, I'm letting the trigger be
'Cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me
And then I get a slap or dap from niggas slinging quarter keys
Just trying to make it, then of age, come through, take it
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be working Nikki's butt naked
At Magic City, shaking titties just to pay the rent
Lord, trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent
But I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinking
I think about Barack, strap myself and keep on danking
'Cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain
If you cross my path, I'll leave you draining like a fountain
Yes it's been like that since way back, in 1975
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive

You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya

My baby mama went celibate
Lies on my breath, she say she couldn't take the smell of it
Tired of the rumors, every room had an elephant
Tryna find her shoes, rummagin’ through the skeletons
She took away sex, took me out of my element
I tried to do the single-dad mingle-dance
At the club with the iron in my wrinkled pants
You could fall much faster than you think you can
Big hands for my ring, I'ma need a Pringles can
I just want the shine back like a Eagles fan
My ego like, ""Ah damn, there he go
Prayin' again, again, the same ol’ thang""
I mean, I ain't gon' promise that the pain go away
And you can take your sweet time, but she ain't gon' wait
'Cause a new coat of paint don't make the stain go away
But he go high (We love You, God)
And we go high
They go low, we go…
Higher, higher

My wife nanny like Fran Drescher
Three damn Grammys, my Granny like, ""No pressure""
So much style, my stylist got no dresser
Fuck goin' straight to the pros, I’m professor
Fuck bein’ one of the G.O.A.T.s, I'm Gotenks
Tried to try that with my girl, she ""No thanks""
Dropped the bomb, I couldn’t find a Tom Hanks
Got me pressed, tryin' to find DeVon Frank
Who the fuck rocked the boat? It's gon' sank
Shootin’ at me point blank with those blanks
They don't take teenage angst at no banks

Tried some new hues like Langston gon' paint
You gotta come harder than that

We give the glory to You, God
One livin' true God, You make us booyah
And throw up the Wu like U-God
They prop up statues and stones, try to make a new God
I don't need a EGOT, as long as I got You, God
Deep breathe, the woosah
Pretty sure I need You in this season like a flu shot
I just sit and wait like I'm with Kirsten when she shoe shop
Know you always with me like how Diddy be with Blue Dot
Got us movin' 'round without the straps like a tube-top
Got me big comfy like Molly's couch
Floatin' 'round the city like Malcolm X dolly'd out
They highly doubt, I guarantee it
This the part of my life my Lifetime movie prolly 'bout
When they come to jump a board, I won't ollie out
I too was once a snotty nose with a potty mouth
One day you get 1 OAK, then poppied out
And poppin' out don't seem as popular as just passin' out
When time get rationed out, you get rational
Folks become pageants inside the fashion house
They start to clash and you let 'em hash it out
But stay passive, so if they crash, you got a fastened belt (Huh)
Lord bless my lineage, let me be the skinniest
Let me get some time with him, let him know who Kenny is

Speakin' of guts, hers pokin' out like Winnie in the red shirt

Spring is alive in Carolina
Deep in the forest where the foxfire glows
High on a mountain, down in a holler
Thunder and lightnin' so it goes
Verse 1
Over a hundred years ago we came to Carolina
Far across the water, it's a long hard road
With little more than courage
We came seeking independence
A little less than nothin' is a heavy load
Verse 2
From the heather to the highlands
We have found the Smoky Mountains
Hard work and simple ways
And life is good, life is good
Refrain
Spring is alive in Carolina
Deep in the forest where the foxfire glows
High on a mountain, down in a holler
Thunder and lightnin' so it goes
Part 2, You Are
Verse 3
You are every mornin' sunrise
You are every rain
You are every peal of laughter
You are every cry of pain
Verse 4
You are all the summer flowers
You are all the falling leaves
You are everyone rejoicin'
You are everyone who grieves
Verse 5
You are all my unknown secrets
You are all my hidden fears
You are known in lover's kisses
You are seen in childhood tears
Verse 6
You are where the stars are shinin'
You are where the rainbow ends
You are why the war is over
You are how the peace begins
Part 3 Whisper the Wind
Verse 7
Whisper the wind over the water
Whisper the wind all through the night
Whisper the wind along the canyon
Whisper the wind into the light

Whisper the wind your precious name

Listen! Listen!
{Verse 1: KRS-One]
Too much brrr brrr brr
Too many people getting brrred 
All you hear is brrr brrr brr in the streets
People gripping they heat just to settle they beefs
Now you getting chased by police
You running to the west, running to the east
But the problem is you under the beast
Brr brr brr - now your brother's deceased
We need peace, not brrr in the streets
The brrr in Iraq lasts for weeks
Wack rappers, I'm crushing these creeps
Every time I spit they get weak

I take you back to the days when the telephone used to rrring
I'm reading the sacred script, KRS, Battlecat, Snoop in it, uh!

Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen
While I'm at the top, upfront getting it in
Open doors, fuck that cuh, we kick them in

No more slave mentality, cause now we the masters
Ready for whatever cause you know that they after us
Clear the scene with the beam, cuh, this shit could get disastrous

By any means necessary, peeking out the window
Watching all this sucker shit, look at the pretenders
Thinking how the rap game was
I dig, I dug, I push, I shove, yeah I fell out of love
But it ain't no thing, telephone ring
They don't make 'em like they make 'em when I used to bang
So I try to show the little homies different things
How to diversify, and change different lanes
Learn to read a little, exercise your brain
Mental gymnastics, it's a cold game
Always knew that they would try and trip me, trick me but they couldn't
Cause all my teachers and doctors were curious to the furnace
The honorable speaks
Like Minister Louis Farrakhan my influence is deep
Cause it's truth
What's that? You don't like that?
Well we fight back. And we'll be right back

647,mick jenkins_strange love,"London - So is there only one healing component, which is love?
Mick - Yeah I think...you know, like I said that's what Jesus was down here to show us, that is literally what he showed us, like that's what- what his purpose was on this Earth. Umm, spread love and spread God's message and, and...eventually his love for us is what led him to die on the cross

Was never here to lessen your glow
I wanna see it intensified
I wanna see my niggas learning lessons and attempting to grow
I see my cousin whip get hit from the side, they swiss cheesed it
In a swift moment most niggas would misread it as well
When your dealings not as well as you've been meaning to tell
Can't tell me nothing fam, I've seen it myself
Walked away from niggas needed my help
I mean how I'ma give you what I clearly still need for myself?
Underwater tryna breathe for myself
Going deep so the pressure is massive
Really tryna be a saint, but I ain't Drew Brees I never been that passive
Always been this pensive
Niggas claiming that I'm changing cause my clothes ain't always been expensive
Always been eccentric
Never been as fake as but it came to extensions
The poems always been extensive
See this story hasn't yet been stenciled
Or adapted to some whack ass Tyler Perry minstrel movie
I detest the pretentious bougie
Motherfuckers whose presence I digest like meat
I'm vegetarian let's digress to some shit that move me
Tell shawty if we kick it then I'm just like Kangol
Girl I'm at your kufi
Introspective questions, hope you ain't no goofy
What you think about the black man?
Tell me what you know about love
Ain't no right or wrong answer
I just know we could go deeper
It's a story, every stanza
Gotta speak in allegory, spread love the new mantra
It's the healing component, it's the healing component
It's the light for the evils like a fucking patronus
Standing banded with my brothers, black Nicholas Jonas
Fuck my last name them hoes used to own us
No weapon formed against me, please don't even walk up on us
Dunkin Donuts in my coffee cause I been smelled the Folger's
I just walked in on you bitch, smell the doja
What's the basis? All these racist motherfuckers out here raping the culture
On the lowest of keys, they sowing hate for ourselves then throw bait
To kill and appropriate, they vultures
Ain't immune to reproach
Have your fucking hands up if you choose to approach us
Fuck around with the fuck around, we still might shoot

It's sipping when it's weak sauce, it's shots if it's cracking
Sip it when we tear up, and chug it if we laughing
Fuck it if we're fucked up I never thought of Chatham
Until the day they said I would have to chat without 'em
And I'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right
Here's a brighter bulb for your limelight
And this is your night, homie, shine bright
This for everybody's fucking prom night

And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

Uh, yo, this prom shit feel like the Grammys, yo
These pictures Granny took gonna make me ask, ""Where'd Granny go?""
So pass the Sanyo to Auntie Jo
And snap a couple candids to the family, get some cameos
You can change the clocks but you can't change hours
I'm waiting on the day Spring can't bring flowers
Let me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours
And pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers
And hop up in that limo, the hood going dummy
The hood fucking love me, the hood think we lovely
So go and pop some bubbly, this right here's to loyalty
This to a moment's glimpse at royalty
This is for my momma Jann who spoiled me
Look what we've accomplished
Time flies, watches look like magnets on a compass
Before we dip, Gladys said a prayer over the limo
Bumping 10 Day with the angels with Jesus shopping my demo
And rode up out of Chatham, the whole hood clapping
And damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened
But it didn't, I missed prom, I missed it to spin
I did a show at AKIN and I would do it again

'Cause it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

Look at, look at your business tux, all night airplane
Go and get your racist on, all white everything
I'm on my paper now, put that on my heading
I ain't even write this down, I don't write e'rything
I know y'all don't like everything
She want a night she can call her wedding
Giving Eskimo kisses, with some Eskimo bitches
Nose diving, going all night sledding
Coked out like, ""Don't change when you grow up
I hope you get some change when you blow up""
'Cause honestly I've always loved the way that you could throw up
Rest up on my shoulder, float up, flying lotus
""You deserve a warm towel, you deserve a soda
You deserve a quiet room, you deserve a sofa
You deserve a Ferrari and a matching tiara
And a hand to wipe away all that running mascara""
But I, I want to thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
I really enjoyed my prom night

It's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

So good, so right, hey baby
So good, so right

653,joey bada$$_hardknock,"Check it, word word
What's the word word
Yeah, check!

Just got word from my mans on the island
He said he needed guidance
Niggas on the streets is wilding, he look to God but can't find him
So he demand silence from the glaring sirens
The sympathy symphony, only thing playing is the banned violence
No lying niggas just won't let go the iron
They wanna burn your molecules until you let go ions
Treat beef like they let go lions
So don't eye 'em they get the wrong message, wrong methods
Put you on that long stretcher
Too much pressure, God bless ya when the semi wet'cha
They told me, ""More dress-up""—I'm giving too many lectures
And I'm putting in too many effort in my nouns and verbs
Like ""they gon' catch up"" fuck what you must heard!
But I done puffed enough herb
To be listening to young birds and dumb nerds
I got enough shit on my mind
So I don't need to be stressing and shine, it's fine

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

Got a collect call from up top
My cousin called me and whatnot
The motto never changed it’s still fuck cops
We went from having lunch in our lunchbox
Our lungs was hot whenever we'd puff pot
We'd touch blocks and end up having to duck shots
But fuck dot, ain’t trying live that life no more
My mind corrupted but my heart is still pure
Gotta be brave can’t be afraid
Braids and waves never matter when you catch the fade
Trapped in a maze and your faith is your only escape
Fuck a priest’s opinion, knock the hinges off of Heaven’s gates
Trying to share my cells with my mate, not share a cell with mates
Wrecking shit with my recklessness
The L get lit that’s when I start second guessing shit
Thinking 'bout Ty and then I reminisce
What you thought you niggas could’ve fuck me over
Never nigga guess again
I’m street so cross me like pedestrians
And that’s gon' be the end of it, straight revoking your membership

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this

Niggas wanna know what I’m about—I’m 'bout blowin' loud
On the block sporty, Glock 40 in a politician mouth
I take the competition out commission with my composition
Who the kid spitting behind the bars like a con position
Gotta give ‘em time to listen, they’ll soon bump to it
They’ll like me, I kick it like Nike they’ll soon adjust to it
But if you hate I know you must do it
I ain’t mad at you I keep my attitude on ""screw it a million bucks should do it""
I’m out for presidents to represent me
Yo chick keep messaging me, who the bestest MC? They be mentioning me
Too hot, I be molesting the beat, fuck math
Teachers should teach us to get Smith & Wesson’s off of the street
So first class be a lesson for me
Fuck what you teaching for some regents, I'm flying over regions
Reaching, all time highs where Jesus can’t reach us
Censor me and get the recipe to make you rest in peace
This is for my niggas, killers, hundred dollar billers
On the block in the rock spot, Glock cocked watching out for cops
All about their cheddar, young guns know nothing that’s better
Like fuck a prison letter, those Beretta’s led us to the lettuce
Relish fetishes, menaces want the senator’s percentages
If you ain't prejudice you still a nemesis
Smoking on the Clematis, get open like a present is
Now your presence is on the premises for them presidents
My city be the genesis for where they think the terror is
They linking terrorists from the Stuy to Lincoln Terraces
Stay on that reckless shit, they leave you left for the dead
Kids don’t play they’ll erase your head in a race for the bread
Children on the corners slinging some regs, popping some meds
Jakes be so deep in cover they be chasing the feds
I be back stage gripping haze breaking my leg
My folks was making the best when they was naked in bed, muthafucka

One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is

Sometimes, you gotta come back down (It's all going to hell now, man)
Stoop to someone's level (Yeah)

Five dozen flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You're dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die cussin' (Yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (What?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (Leg, I see)
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""Fuck it""
Pile the carnage up 'til it's so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (Yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black
But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now

I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned, been
Countless times I've been doubted
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (Yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and (What?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That's part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing, I vow to outsmart 'em and beat 'em
My God, what a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
This evil is calling, I'm already seething and

I'm leaving Heaven

Where I am going

Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (Yeah)
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep (Yeah)
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the dear ol' dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the fuck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only guts you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say ""I hate you"" to your face
No coming back from where I'm going
Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel
Dig with the blade of it then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil

I'm leaving Heaven (Yeah)
I'm leaving Heaven (You know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)
Angels won't find me (Just to spit in your fucking face)
Where I am going (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
I'm leaving Heaven (Fuck you, bitch)
I'm leaving Heaven (You know what? Maybe if I hadn't had you)
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)
Where I am going (Or maybe I should say, ""Thank you"")
('Cause I wouldn't have been me, haha)

So you better, you better run (Yeah)

Dead 'em from every side of the spectrum
Hannibal Lecter lecture, body part bone collector
Nosy ass hoes get punched in the septum
That's part of the woes for throwing salt like Epsom
Pardon my bros, kinda off the rocker and steps
Don't step, stupid, or you get slept stupid

Get rich and make some babies that's weirder than Will and Jada's

Lately, I've been strugglin' with ways to get my stock up
Me and Venus workin' on new videos to blockbust and city shows and pop-ups
And really though I feel as though there's no bitch I could not fuck

Boy, you're just Leonardo
Born in the life you had to learn to be part of
Still, no deal, still whippin' the Mazda, but fuck

""Niggas ain't seein' you, Venus""—shit, and I ain't seeing me
So many nights at the bottom, swore I was ET
My mama beat me, mu'fuck a degree
I chose both pills—my thoughts 3D
And often I probably come off so off the deep beat
That a lil' nigga like me gotta keep at least two or three BPs
In the blunt, they're off a DP as the rain pops off of these street
And the pain pops me another one to the brain
I let the strain do what you can't, I know it's hard out tryna reach me, huh
I'm battling addiction, I'm deep in premonitions
I'm clutching on my last dollars, I'm stretching common sense
A pressure point a keeper so I question my existence
Be assessing my involvement, second-guessing my delivery

Out of luck, out of hope to fuck up

She never played with dolls or lacy kinds of things
Jenny counted boxcars instead of counting sheep
She could go anywhere when she went to sleep
All she ever talked about was getting on to ride
She was living in another time you could see it in her eyes
And every day after school she'd head down to the track
Waiting for the train that was never coming back
Jenny dreamed of trains
When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true
Jenny dreamed of trains
The depot's been boarded up, the rails have turned to rust
There hasn't been a train through here since the mill went bust
No one believed her when she said she heard the train
Said she was just a little girl acting kind of strange

When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true

In God we trust she walked away

I'm feeling the dough, and now I'm feeling the real
Stunning with the stunner, man, I'm one in a mil
Hold on to my hands while we walk up this hill
There's a mountain and a fountain but the waters are still
Walk in the light but I'm changing drill
Me and my homies gangbang on the field
Take a knee, make a G, follow protocol
Can't you see us kick, Capri?
Back with the Wonder Dog
Not the underdog, can't you understand?
Please believe me, I'm with Stevie
Mental wonderland
Or maybe Michael Jackson
Pure satisfaction
Rest in pussy, Hugh Hef
Playboy Mansion
Been a foe, mental fold
Split the difference punk bitch
You on a centerfold
One is soul, never told, forever G
C'est la vie, that's me

Tell me what you got for me
I'm getting on the good foot
And see I'm only here to rock wit ya
They tell me that's a good look
See, I'ma keep doing me, 'cause that's all I know
So knick-knack, paddy-wack, Kid Capri and Snoop is back
We do it just it just like this that back (back)

They tried to run a game on a nigga
Word to P.E, shame on a nigga
I never paid attention
Did I forget to mention
I started up cooking up the cavi in the kitchen
Then I graduated, matter of fact I made it
Reinstated but still kept it gang related
I traveled the globe, private jets, and Versace robes
Penthouse suites, what about phony hoes?
Tanqueray glasses, smoke fills the air
And hoes with fat asses playing truth or dare
No bizaar, what a lovely pair
And they all came here just to fuck wit a player
Anytime I wanna jam, shit I'm runnin' through these hoes
Like a pack at the Coliseum
Marcus Allen, Bo Jackson, and Bo Diddley
If you know like I know, you come and fuck wit me, fo' real

Tell me what you got for me
I'm getting on the good foot
And see I'm only here to rock wit ya
They tell me that's a good look
See, I'ma keep doing me, 'cause that's all I know
So knick-knack, paddy-wack, Kid Capri and Snoop is back

Macadelic
America

I'm, in a room filled with holographic images
Path is limitless, death, well, that's ridiculous
I'ma live forever, 'cause a legend never die
See the world as simple, but complex in the design
I spent some time just thinkin'
Where did that get me? High, more drinkin'
Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list
Try to understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Ancient, halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out that the perfect world a lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal as a loaded gun
And I'ma shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run
Mac Miller, I'm the only one
But I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium

Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split (Uh)

Still, in a room filled with holographic images
Crushin' information into powder, then I'm sniffin' it
Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed
Iller than the future death of you ingestin' Sudafed
Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest
Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress (Uh)
See, this is what I do the best
Nothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest
Save hard, a Braveheart, a warrior
I take part to stay far from coroners
I heard some corny words said about my music though
Talkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho
Most Dope, got you hooked, yellin', ""Rufio""
First you lose your mind, then you lose your soul
So what you talkin' about? Thinkin' you out of options
American born, impeccable form
Above and beyond, never the norm

Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split (Uh)
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public (Yeah)

Shout out my wigga Mac Miller, comin' up in a world full of killers
I'll be shaded up at the villa
With a girl that know what the deal is
Yeah, they know I come from the illest
City on the map, we don't know how to act, ah!
Realest young rap go-getters in America
Bad chicks get tossed around like the merry-go
CV and Mac Meezy takin' off on PJ's
We the future, so every night is a new day
Sittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low
Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show
I can trigger the wave in my sleep
Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat, ah!
Wake up shower, get paid and repeat
Spit one flow and got made on the streets
Welcome to the land where you never stay for free
Swag worth a mill, drop cast let it deal

Rise to the top and topics change
To Glocks and the Stock Exchange
Now watch the price of life on the block drop, insane
You can't stop this reign, don't name-drop in vain
Inhale toxic flames from tropic strains, it's awkward, strange
Last week he was nothin', boxers stain
Now everybody love him and chicks offer top for fame
To the top I aim, testin' waters, so I've been afloat
No deal but flow so real, he been in the scopes
Sun got shine, now they say he shady, but he never dippin' though
Still facin' L's, you would think a nigga wins was low

Man, you're never seein' home and you never see the domes
I can feel it when I write, point of livin' in the right
If they only see the wrongs, never listen to the songs
Just to listen is a fight, but you booked me for the fight
It's so hard to get along if they only see the slight
From the love of religion
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it seem like nobody love me
I'm not tryna lead you to Visas
But if I try to lead you to Jesus
We get called halfway believers

I'ma say I grew
They gon' say I pulled a switcharoo
But they is who?
All that jogging in place is cool
But that shit stayed in school for me partly because somebody was brutally honest
Pointed out social constructs I foolishly honored
I booted these false concepts that diluted these waters
Was trying to be true to the nigga I was claiming to be
Now I'm really real
Trying to get old like a philly shell
Don't nobody want no smoke with me, from spoken words to poetry
To polarizing social content posted I got more of the type
And it all took a sprite from advice
That one wouldn't considered nice
That's alright, it helped me take flight
I used to fall but the floor is so velvety
That we still had the Velveeta stacking nice
Rarely flexing or advertising

You'll lose me every time trying to align myself with real niggas
You confuse me every time you say you're feeling free
Can't see where my ceiling be
Think that's why those trapped in boxes can't see where I'm coming from
We just ain't there mentally
Expose myself to myself

Music for my niggas with the felonies
And fellas with some fellas who done left the scene
And strippers with asses, all hella queens

See when it's a shortage they bet on me
And quiet time, babe that's the remedy
It's a new road I ain't been down

Couple shows for a couple pennies

And an empty stomach but I don't eat nothin'

Even biters will tournament, to see who can be me
Better than me, it's a permanent, smile on my face
Because you said you don't like my style
But that's OK but just make sure you don't touch that dial
And we'll be cool, touch it and you's a fool
Look, I'll get you hooked, y'all crooks might even move
To Atlanta, Georgia, get a wife and daughter
Start a new life, and all that wrong you do you'll make it right

Out there lookin' for love after dark
Then I get tired and it's an afterthought
Where's the love? Five question marks
Eat your heart out, I had to starve
It's the saddest part
I'm questionin' myself, I ain't gotta answer yours

Never knew takin' a breather could be so physical
Never knew takin' it easy could be so difficult
Never knew takin' these drugs could be so spiritual
Never knew the chemist like how I know the chemicals
Never knew takin' a life could be so minuscule
Never know takin' chances will be individual
Never know takin' advantage would be inhospitable, how pivotal
Never knew the shit I never knew would be minimal, how cynical
Never knew love and hate were similar, identical

I been lookin' for some love, but it ain't lookin' for me

I can't find the keys to this life
Picked the locks, I might be a'ight
Close my eyes, I might see the light
Life is a bitch, she might be my type
Death is a bitch, she might be tonight
Haters kiss and dick-eaters bite

When I was in seventh grade, my grandfather told me, ""Don't get caught loving the streets, 'cause they never gon' love you back."" But I feel like it's all we got, so it's all we really do love. At the end of the day, I feel like the problem is the people that control it don't really come from here. So they can't do nothing but, you know, look down on us. We look at them, we see somebody that could help; they look at us and all they see is a nigga. But it don't really matter anyway. We all gon' die one day, man. One day.

Do doves cry when a Black man die, or do we croak with crows?
The young catch gunshots, the old catch the Holy Ghost
Ho, I love not, I never seen no pot of gold
Just bar windows and six-fours with no switches
Was broke with no bitches; she love me, though
You'll kill me if it make you richer
What you screaming you my brother for?
Heart is where the hatred is, the brain'll stain the love below
And life is what you make it, so I'm making money for my folks

I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make my momma proud, feel like her only son
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
With everything I need, with everything I want
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To do it like nobody has ever done

When most people look at a person who does what I do, they look at us with these preconceived notions, as if it's a set way for us all to be. But we all people at the end of the day, so I wonder why we don't treat each other like it. You looking at a person, telling them that they story don't matter, really no better than me, walking down the street tryna shoot at somebody. 'Cause all we got is these dreams, man, and y'all ain't never had to not have nothing. And that's the last thing you want for anybody is to not really have nothing at all.

I been through Hell and back, I seen my momma cry
Seen my father hit the crack, then hit the set, then flip the sack
I done seen my homies die, then went on rides to kill 'em back
So how you say you feel me when you never had to get through that?
We live for they amusement like they view us from behind the glass
No matter what we grow into, we never gon' escape our past
So in this cage they made for me exactly where you find me at
Whether it's my time to leave or not, I never turn my back

I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make my momma proud, feel like her only son
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
With everything I need, with everything I want
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one

Yeah, this the right year made the flow, yeah
Clear and easy to steer in the space and time erasing fine
Amazing in the maze of clichés
Each day weighs out enlightenment
Niggas blacked out 'cause I got ultra violent
Now my wave lengths to the radio waves
Still keep it under pavements but not a ratio change
My patio the same, but I ain't even got to tell them that
Poppy leave them dimes at my welcome mat
Get high as heavens, hope he'll never come back
I'm like 5'11, but have angelic contact
The devil jealous in fact, 'cause I rebel the spells
With a letter to God, I swear you know me so well
This one time, I said, ""Lord, would you help?""
Some short time after, see my music on the shelf
And of course, I gotta thank myself
My wealth is in my happiness and mind
And not my pocket health in its ashes

If its passion let relationships synchronize

Taking hold of pitchforks still, but I will never yield
In this pitchfork hold thinking I gotta appeal
'Cause I'm thinking like a deal could get me living swell for real
But if I skyfall, thinking ideal

Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, ""What are those?""
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid

Fell in love with a stripper, Lord, I know she got bills
But I'ma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'm a mess
And now she over talking about staying over
And she ask could she call her clan over?
I say that's the shit and now we asshole-ing
Now fast forward 'til the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, makeup, and lashes
Out of place mattress, shit happens 'cause my days is a mess

I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into Petrol
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

With my drawers hid but my hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon-toed
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
And two missing toes
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe

The type to love from a distance, not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block underarms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas, hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously, they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against us, we tryna get lucky, doper than Lucky
You're ending happy, that's only a tugging
Like Satan masturbating, shit come hot, but y'all still love me

I said, get up
You know what happens when I'm around, man
Woo! Let's go
Better watch out now 'cause here we come
And we ain’t stoppin' until we see the morning sun
So give us room to do our thing 'cause we ain’t come to hurt no one
So everybody come and get up on the floor now and grab someone

Man, first of all; I’m a boss, I just want to get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it’s a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows, spray-painted doors
With the flames on ‘em, Michigan plates, and my name's on ‘em
Baby, Shady’s here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain’t stupid so quit tryna run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryna put your claims on him?
'Cause you won’t do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There’s a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance?
She’s got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call ‘em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps down
And show this hussy who’s the man now get amped, dance

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (White trash party)
So let’s have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain’t no one but us trash
You don’t know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we’re having a white trash party (White trash party)

Pull a fifth of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care, like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Living Dead
And tomorrow I'll probably still be too high to get out of bed
'Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
I'm mixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like I’m hollering ""Die Santa""
Missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryna play the wall like you Paul
And get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for the ladies in the minis
But I’m not throwin' ones, fives, 10's, or even 20's
I’m throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny’s from the North, East, and West
But when it comes to them trailers in them South parks
Muffle it, 'cause, homie, that hood’s tighter than Kenny’s
So, ladies, if your belly button’s not an innie, then I’m outtie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
Come on

Now you can do this on your own

Now whether you’re black, white, or purple, if you’re misunderstood
But you don’t give a fuck, you ain’t doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you’re up to evil and you’re no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your hood

Now honey, don’t let them pricks trip, we should make a quick dip
And go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot, 'cause, girl—I got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift
And make a five-seater, I’ll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain’t like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L-to-the-I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I don’t need a tank top to be a wife beater
I’ll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I’ll tell you now, I’m so raw, I still need to unthaw
You feel me, y'all? I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like that’s against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up

Now you can do this on your own

Chased out with a knife
With a face like Bob Marley
And a mouth like a motor bike

Oh well, the bars are always open
And the time is always right
And if God's good word goes unspoken
The music goes all night
And it goes:

If I were Bob Marley, I'd say ""Could you be loved?""
And If I was Half Pint, or with my Lord, up above
If I was Mike Tyson, I would look for a fight
And If I was a Boomtown Rat, I would be staying up all night
If I was the king Ad-Rock, I would get stupid dumb
If rhymes were Valiums, I'd be comfortably numb
But if I had a shotgun, you know what I'd do
I'd point that shit straight at the sky
And shoot heaven on down for you


I want a lover, but I can't find the time
I want a reason, but I can't find the rhyme
And I want to start some static, but I can't afford
To get slammed to the ground like I fell off my skateboard, hey
Nowadays, as clear as you please:
Get strapped with protection, or strap with disease

Laughter, it's free
Any time, just call me:

Funky fresh hits
You get nothing

Stolen from an Africa land
I was chased out of the bar

Get hip, get hip
Don't slip, you knuckle heads
Racism is schism, on a serious tip
You don’t believe me, then I g'won bust your lip
Higher the mountain, it hard to climb
Rougher the rhythm, then it must be Sublime

Go and raid the sound, an' tell the people the news

Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
