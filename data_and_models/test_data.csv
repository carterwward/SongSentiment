Whatever…
Talking bout blah blah blah blah blah blah

Man I swear for God, man I shit you not
I done lived two lives on earth before
Second time I died, got a word from God like, “Doc could you do one mo'?”
And I told him, “Third time's the charm.”
Who am I to argue with God?
Who are you to argue with me for letting the beast come out of the prophet?
I’m a loopy type of nigga
If she pregnant, get her wet ‘til she deliver
Heat the skillet, cook placenta, call that dinner
Don’t that make you want to lick your fingers?
Don’t that make you want to grab a female?
Put her knees into her chest and bite her ankles while she take it
I’m cracking up at your face ‘cuz you recognize the shit that I say
Is over your head. It’s over your head, what else can I say?
I’m under your bed; I’m a monster
Guess that’s why niggas sleeping on us
‘Cuz walking on water just ain’t enough
And you’re kind of sus, 'spect to me
I don’t trust the shit that you making up
Well shit, let me put it like this
Let me put it like this, let me put it like this;
I’m what you get if Lauryn Hill slipped up and let Juvenile hit
And then they crazy asses let Angela Davis babysit
So raise them fists
Quit complaining bitch! If you mad then change some shit
We keep it colder than the boldest bitch’s nipples, skinny dippin’
Un-forgiven by so many men who wish to 50 cent him
Talkin’ bout how is he still shittin’?
Thought by now he would be empty!
All this power in my system; only 5% gon’ get this! (ugh!)

Bless us, Paul
In the midst of praying, we just playing for a ass to palm
Smoke a little grass to calm
Crack that book open to Psalms
Crack a nigga head and pick a verse and hope he make it home
No this not a gangsta song, I don’t really know about that life
And if they asking questions tell em “I don’t really know about that.” Right?
See this could be my blessing on the same day as my last night
But I swear I fucking lived it. you can put that on my past life
I say Neesee hold your head up, ‘til it’s light as a feather
Ah-yea-nah I ain’t gon-en-dah-ah-yea-nah I ain’t gon let up
See I'm positive he punish pussy niggas, for the record
Nope I’on’t believe in hell, but, hell, I know it’s gonna catch ‘em
Jodi, line ‘em up and check ‘em
Slice ‘em from head to stomach
You see them bellies full, but I’m hungry as a mother
With a 10-puppy litter
Check and ain’t shit in the cupboard
Dodge 18-wheelers for supper
You 18? Well, girl, come on up!
And that glitter bet’ not rub off
My Massachusetts jump-off
I ain’t psychic but I but it; I can see right through your eyelids
Just a little lost Bambi in the sticks, tryna' hide it
Bought some titties, tryna' hide it
Bought some Remy to disguise it
Threw some fangs on that bit
Now you running with the lions
In the club surrounded by pretty corpses, kind of frightening
But I stay high
Keep my eyes low so they can’t read my thoughts girl

Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of one-hunnid-thousand but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need ya!
The world don't need ya, don't let them deceive ya
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
Fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it, I swear—

Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too

(Loving you ain't really complicated)
""Housekeeping, housekeeping""
(What I got to do to get to you?)
""¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!""
(To you)
""¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto!""
(Loving you ain't really complicated)

Are you the reason why mom and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it
I know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he'd recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, ""You fuckin' failed,"" you ain't try

*Sniffling*

I know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk *gulping*
I cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets, don't let me tell 'em to the world
About that shit you thinkin' and that time you *gulping*, I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Should've killed yo' ass long time ago
You should've felt that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if these mirrors could talk it'd say, ""You gotta go""

Will these niggas let me sip my ginger ale? You can tell that I’m parched
On point like a dart or a pen with the ball, don’t start, I can tell that you aren't
What you want, the gold and the hoes and the lights?
The cars and the clothes what a life
Do your stars get chose and your bars get low when you're dull as a fucking butter knife
Can’t cut shit, can’t touch this, it’s a masterpiece
When the pen attack the leaf
But it’s all in a stroke on some paintbrush shit, they've been shooting in the streets and I ain’t ducked yet
We still here, 79th and Phillips, hope you brought a Philips cause niggas like to drill here
Won’t cut it with a flathead, put it in your back if you lack with yo' sack or yo' flat red
Irritate the white skin, like a black-head, I just pray to God you don’t flatline
I just play the background, Spacetime on the board, you can check a nigga stat line
Smoke tree now, spit it with a black lip, had to take a little break like halftime
Felines want the green like catnip, I just want my shit bumping in your alpine

Like when Danica Patrick got good with the handling
Dismantling the plans of the industry management (ooh)

Ain't we s'posed to still be slaves?
Nigga might’ve read too much
Saw the rape taking place in my face in the hood
On some Drake shit, a nigga might’ve cared too much, so I guess I’m in my feelings
Been so fucking focused on the flow that I didn’t even notice that I ain’t got no ceiling
Peeling back the truth of the matter like damn, why these niggas lie so much?
Healing rap, the truth to the matter is, I’m so ahead that I ain’t never had to try to front
Don’t try your luck, don’t taint the green, nice with the paper never had to buy a blunt
Exceed expectations like a pop fly when you tried to bunt
Field goal when you tried to punt

Even with the bitter cup
Forgave my brothers and drank up
Did everything but gave up
Stab my back, I can't front
Still we win, we prayed up
Even when we die, we raise up (Hallelujah)
Ain't no wantin', no, we need it
The powers that be done been greedy
We need ours by this evening
No white flag or no treaty
We got the product, we got the tools
We got the minds, we got the youth
We goin' wild, we on the loose
People is lying, we are the truth
Everything old shall now become new
The leaves’ll be green, bearing the fruit
Love God and our neighbor, as written in Luke
The army of God and we are the truth

1206,1228,eminem_asshole,"Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speakin' to children
Everything was happenin' so fast
It was like I blinked—sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
‘Cause I was gettin' sick of this feelin'
Like I'm always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really thinkin': ""If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him.""
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit
What I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawin' more attention toward it
‘Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, I'd just zone out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like tellin' Gwen Stefani she sold out
‘Cause I was tryna leave no doubt
In anyone's mind, one day I'd go down in history
Think they know now because everybody knows

Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Thanks for the support, asshole! *scratch*
Thanks for the support, asshole!

Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he roundabout
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, well goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhandin' a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck's all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt—word to Pacquiao
Momma said, ""There ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out!""
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo
My soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm takin' no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changin' back into that old maniac
In fact, there they go tryna dip out the back door retreatin'
‘Cause everybody knows

Everybody knows
That you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows
So don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed, ""ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work?""
‘Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm makin' up words so you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
‘Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
‘Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
‘Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
‘Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
‘Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father
And I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
And motherfuck father time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist
Who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half-alive
Poured my half-empty glass in a cup
Now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
I’m goin' back to what got me here
Yeah, cocky, and can’t knock bein' rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows

Everybody knows

For a minute
Uh
Yo
6 classes from a diploma, my homie say he proud of me
Let's celebrate, so he grabbed him a bottle when he was on his way over
A chain smoker 6 squares from carcinoma, said he be stressed
And I feel him for real. He said the streets ain't got me yet
And these cigarettes is the last of my worries. Boy I done seen children get killed
On accident. And you know it could of been me for real
Plus I can't blow the dope, I just got me job
So if these little white sticks help me ease my mind, from all the times
I worry about losing my life, dying from smoke instead of getting smoked
Is just fine. The irony, and honesty I can see his eyes
And obviously he can see the same things as I
Look up in my eyes and see the dichotomy of our lives
Seen eye to eye on many things, one thing we can’t deny
Two different paths. Cut from the same cloth, but I made a fit out of mine
He tried to do the same thing but it ain't fit like mine
You know I dabbled but I was just in a school
He dropped out before they constitution test him. Even had a jump shot
Always said he'll be a shooter, he just grabbed a Smith and Wesson
Went from bike riding and scrapes all on his knees
To serving p's now he got goals of serving keys, damn
You know you can break out
I told him, I told him, I told him
You know you can break out
You know you can break out right

Mostly likely to succeed I had goals of a degree
I was being hot though still hitting stains for sneaks
He move like bleach staining everything just to eat
Moms ain't love him. He told me though, I ain't have to see
I moved out the house. He had to leave. By 24
2 felonies, would been three but the judge was reduced it cause he was 15
Nah said we wasn't in the projects, but we black so it's no way to escape the nonsense. Never wanted to come to my crib, cause my mindset
That was enforced by the things that my mom did
Reminded him his mom wasn't trying, we ain’t get that close until we got older
Conversations over struggles what made us closer
Thought I had it together. Man I just kept composure
I thought he was cool , but he was broken, barely sober
Blowing dossier, he did that to hold him over
He looked me in the eyes back when I was like 19
And he wanted to be like me, I just wanted to be free
I guess he wanted the same thing, damn

Knock you off your feet and then I flee before the jakes come
Sick of hearin' cases from these niggas who ain't face none
But I'ma be the nigga that they feelin' when the day come
Thirsty for the pay, young niggas led astray
Stray bullet hit my brother in his mothafuckin' face
What's fate when a person don't deserve what he get?
Shootin' reckless at the father, almost murdered the kid
Or is it karma for the shit that both the parents had did?
Ain't embarrassed where I'm livin', we get merit for kills
From a family of niggas that was veteran skilled
Voted heartless cause my momma made me part of the guild
Deals made, sellin' thrills paid the bills at the crib

And them funerals was usual, I ain't sheddin' no tears
Knew the fallen had it better off than most of us did

The holiest of holy, Nick Nolte in some Oakley's

Sober I can't deal, I'm in the corner with my head low
Runnin' from my shadow, never ending chase
Ease the pain and the battle that's within me
Sniff the same shit that got Whitney, the high heel depression

Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder
Of why we can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, ‘cause—

I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning
Today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half
You wake in its wake to start the mourning process
And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter
It's like an enormous asthma
Thunderstorm has passed ya
You weathered it and poked its eye out with the thornbush that ya
Used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is
Stuffed, so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner faster, more assertive
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But every day is a new learning curve as you steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to
To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
‘Cause they hurt you so bad
It's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket
But you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past
Standing at inferno and chant—

I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

You're so familiarized
With what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died
‘Cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive
Which means you will survive
Although today you may weep ‘cause you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and
Hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in, that's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing
And by tomorrow, you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive 'em, even after all the shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burnin' quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in, but you're fireproof
Flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin'
You look down, ‘cause you're so over 'em you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow, today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this livin' hell
Still, a little piece of you dies as you scream—

I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
It's not with fists, but with wings that I will fly

And I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday

Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that

Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time, she was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen them thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?""
Damn…

And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

I wrote back and said
""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up
I wrote back like, ""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Fuck…

And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

You know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm prayin', ""God, don't let me bust quick!""
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin' and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, ""I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—""

‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

'Cause people don't make the world go round like they used to
But I know if I got one thing
Baby I know got you
Yeah, you keep me sheltered through the six o'clock blues
And if I know one things going to be alright
Then I know that it's me and you (oh, oh)
So they say we're running out of time
We're running out of water
We're running out of light
We all got to many problems
And just not enough answers
But if we keep our own lives then they'll tell us what we like
Oh, but as long as we got each other
There's nothing in the world that can steal my joy
As long as we got each other (we can overcome)
We can overcome the badness of the world
They can sell me a story
And tell me we're in danger
But our love will never die
'Cause people don't make the world go round like they used to
But I know if I got one thing
Baby I know got you
You keep me sheltered through the six o'clock blues
Yeah, you keep me sheltered
Through the six o'clock
Yeah you keep me sheltered, sheltered, sheltered, sheltered
Baby if I know one thing
It's going to be all right
I know that I got my baby
Like the birds that live in the sky
We never have to worry

What's good good? And what's good evil?
And what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?
And why God phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter, wonder if I would follow Him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia, tallied up ten of 'em
I slurped too many pain-kills down, I'm off a lot
I got a lot of off days, but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
You what I mean, I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back 'cause the cops shot you
Buck buck, bang bang, yelling ""Fuck Fox News""
Booyaka buckle up, motherfuck opps too
Ain't no knuckling up 'em young 'cause it just not cool

Nice to see you, Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demon's ass

I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off-white
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white
And both my parents was black
But they saw it fit that I talk right
With my drawers hid but my hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon-toed
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
And two missing toes
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe

Nice to see you, Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demon's ass

Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance, not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block underarms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas, hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously, they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against us, we tryna get lucky, doper than Lucky
You're ending happy, that's only a tugging
Like Satan masturbating, shit come hot, but y'all still love me
Ugh, how Father Time a deadbeat? Maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless, igh

1970,2003,femdot_snuck to mattys,"It's 1:37, I'm supposed to be home at twelve
And the homie that I'm with
Man he supposed to be home as well
Thirty minutes away, I still gotta drop him off
Every 30 minutes make up a lie and call my mom
Know if I get in trouble again my car is gone
Told her that I caught a flat while I was on my way home
And I got pulled over and the cops behind the car
Running my license plate, that's why it's taking so long
Had a old picture of a flat tire from before
That she ain't know about so I texted her as proof
I told her the cops was racist, they told me not to move
And if I did for any reason they said they gone shoot
Well
Certain elements of the story was true
Well we did have a flat, well really more than that
Cause before we left the party man my homie had popped two
And cops was behind us before we left the party to
Run in the house that we had went into
See, let me rewind you
And catch everybody up to how we so late
And so far away from home
It's about 8 o'clock and I just asked my mom
To go out to a party that's 20 minutes down the road
And it's Friday night, the perfect time to ask is now
Cause she tired from work 'cause she just got home
Plus my homie already over so well I know
Well it's a little bit harder for her to say no
She said cool just be home on time
Long as you back by curfew then you'll be fine
Don't be out too late Fem
I know that other kids do but them other people's kids remember
Them not mine
Okay cool so
Now I understand she wasn't having it
Slipped to the basement, to my daddy's cabinet
Where he kept his liquor and I seen the cognac in it
And then he never drink it
So he wouldn't notice I was snatchin' it
Put it in my jacket so my mom ain't seen me grabbin' it
Kissed her on the cheek as I'm ready to leave
It's like 9:03 cause I had to get dressed
So I grabbed the keys, hopped in my little Camry
A little '94 hooptie that was painted forest green
With some dents on the side but still ride smooth
My man said he need some tree, I don't got none I ran out
But it's cool cause I know my guy do
Told him meet us at the function with a 3.5 on him
We'll cop if we have to, my man's a match too
Said the function at my homie crib that I met from playing AAU ball
Cool dude, name was Matthew
Everybody called him Matty
See my mom ain't like Matty
Cause he came from the hood that we had moved from
See we in the 'burbs now
Bout 35 minutes away from the streets that I had grown on
Told my momma I was going to my boy Joe house
Twenty minutes away from the new one
Joe went to my high school, well parents knew him too
Cause you know, nigga came by the house a few times
See Joe ain't get it crackin' like Matty and them did
Cause Matty and them parents wasn't home all the time
So Matty's house was jukin', it was always the move
And it was always the place that everybody would just go
I'm talking gangsters, ball players, cheerleaders, hoopers
And all the card crackers and niggas selling dope
Like my homie Josh that I'm gone cop from
For my homie that I told you about earlier before
We in the whip putting cognac all in our cokes
That we grabbed from the gas station before we hit the road
It's a little traffic right now on 94
So we took a couple shots while it was moving slow
It's like 9:54 by the time we get to Matty's and it's already bussing
Parked two blocks down the road
Walked in, seen Josh had a whole pre-rolled
3.5 in the wood, said he was down to smoke
Seen Jade, that's my ex, but I still be hitting though
And she already T'd, trying to drink out the coke that I got
The music cracking, all the guys in the spot
Know I got about an hour before I head home
I pull Jade to the corner and I'm like what you on
Trying to take something down, you know before I gotta go
So we slide to the car, then I slide down the draws
In the back of the car, after she jawed me
And I got a quickie, that Miguel no hickies
Afterwards we just pop right back in the party
Everybody drunk getting high off pills
And homie took two in the back of the party
Niggas start capping over the girls they smashing
And both of these niggas brought straps to the party
They each brought they niggas, now first nigga start shooting
Everybody scatter as they blast in the party
I grab Jade fast, throw her ass on the ground
As they let off rounds I kneel over to hold her
Adrenaline so high as I take her outside
I ain't notice I had a bullet graze in my shoulder
My man's outside by the car by luck
This dumb nigga said that he forgot his coca-cola
Right before they start shooting, happy to be alive
It's like 11:25, I drop Jade at the corner
To meet with a friend, she was trying to link again at the food spot
That's down by the Kroger
Taking to Josh, he still at the house
He say that Matty laid out on the sofa
Jim, Wahn, PJ, Tanesha all got hit but
Matty the only one who life really over
I'm tweaking out, police pull up and they run up in the house
Niggas all on the street, party leaking out
They asking what happened but nobody know what happened
Cause we all niggas no one know what the police speaking 'bout
11:35 told Jade to stand in line at the food spot
Cause I'm gonna get something just to sober up
Cause if I walk in the house and my momma see I'm drunk
Then I swear to God man it's really gonna be over for
By the time we get through the streets and make it to the food spot
Seen my watch it's 11 like 51
Parked on the street, walk up to the spot
Open the door, see Jade and her friend at the front

Everybody tweetin'
RIP Matty, and pray for Tenesha
They was prom king and queen last weekend
And we was in the same prom group that they was in
So me and Jade felt the same way when we was seated
She looked at my shirt like what happened to your shoulder
I seen a burnt hole and little skin missing
It's starting to burn now
Starting to think if I didn't duck on time it could've been real different
My mans drinking water trying to come down from the pills
But his mom's don't care so I know he gon' be straight
Already told my momma that I caught a flat tire
And I got pulled over cause I knew I was gonna be late
Took 35 minutes for them to make the food
Plus fifteen to eat it 'fore we went outside
Plus we talked for a minute after everyone was finished
So I ain't get to the car until 1:25
We parked right behind Jade, kissed her on the forehead
Let me know when you get home
And be safe when you drive
Now it's 1:37 on the phone with my mom
Saying Imma drop my homie off, be there by 2:05
Well you know, GPS, said like 2:15
But 2:05 sound better so I lied
Spraying down my shirt with some cologne
Pop some gum, grab my jacket, and put some eye drops in my eyes
On my way to drop my mans off at his mom's
He sleep, I tap him on the shoulder when I was outside
Tell me he love me, say I love him back
That's my nigga
As I pull off all up in the ride
I'm going 80 in a 45 to cut down the time
Pull up, park the car, it's 2:09
Walk into my mom with her eyes half open half closed
On the couch she made a deep ass sigh
So she asked me what happened exactly so I lied
Bout these racist cops that pulled me over tonight
They took forever but you know thank God
They let us off with a warning it just took a long time
She asked how was the party
Weren't you supposed to be at a party in the first place
I can't say that it got lit up or she'd never let me out
So I just say it was cool

I can play the guitar like a mother fuckin' riot
Well, life is too short so love the one you got
'Cuz you might get run over or ya might get shot
Never start no static I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with my bulletproof vest
Take a small example take a tip from me
Take all of your money and give it to charity

And the Sublime style still straight from Long Beach

Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers

No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate

And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care

It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound

We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit

Let them niggas sneeze if they sick
Just don't ever bless the bullshit; we're too old

Just breaking habits, I pray for balance, I'm tasting scriptures
Inhaling vapors I'm painting pictures so pristine
Right on your ceiling, the feeling is kinda Sistine
For the art form and never the hand clap
When that's clear you can call it Saran Wrap
Remember when you getting all this green that there's gotta be sand traps
Derails don't only happen at Amtrak
If you don't understand that

My baby mama went celibate
Lies on my breath, she say she couldn't take the smell of it
Tired of the rumors, every room had an elephant
Tryna find her shoes, rummagin’ through the skeletons
She took away sex, took me out of my element
I tried to do the single-dad mingle-dance
At the club with the iron in my wrinkled pants
You could fall much faster than you think you can
Big hands for my ring, I'ma need a Pringles can
I just want the shine back like a Eagles fan
My ego like, ""Ah damn, there he go
Prayin' again, again, the same ol’ thang""
I mean, I ain't gon' promise that the pain go away
And you can take your sweet time, but she ain't gon' wait
'Cause a new coat of paint don't make the stain go away
But he go high (We love You, God)
And we go high
They go low, we go…
Higher, higher

My wife nanny like Fran Drescher
Three damn Grammys, my Granny like, ""No pressure""
So much style, my stylist got no dresser
Fuck goin' straight to the pros, I’m professor
Fuck bein’ one of the G.O.A.T.s, I'm Gotenks
Tried to try that with my girl, she ""No thanks""
Dropped the bomb, I couldn’t find a Tom Hanks
Got me pressed, tryin' to find DeVon Frank
Who the fuck rocked the boat? It's gon' sank
Shootin’ at me point blank with those blanks
They don't take teenage angst at no banks
(We love You, God)
Tried some new hues like Langston gon' paint
You gotta come harder than that

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
It's two different things
It's too bad, and it's so sad
It's too bad, and it's so sad
It's two things (We love You, God)
It's too bad, and it's so sad

We give the glory to You, God
One livin' true God, You make us booyah
And throw up the Wu like U-God
They prop up statues and stones, try to make a new God
I don't need a EGOT, as long as I got You, God
Deep breathe, the woosah
Pretty sure I need You in this season like a flu shot
I just sit and wait like I'm with Kirsten when she shoe shop
Know you always with me like how Diddy be with Blue Dot
Got us movin' 'round without the straps like a tube-top
Got me big comfy like Molly's couch
Floatin' 'round the city like Malcolm X dolly'd out
They highly doubt, I guarantee it
This the part of my life my Lifetime movie prolly 'bout
When they come to jump a board, I won't ollie out
I too was once a snotty nose with a potty mouth
One day you get 1 OAK, then poppied out
And poppin' out don't seem as popular as just passin' out
When time get rationed out, you get rational
Folks become pageants inside the fashion house
They start to clash and you let 'em hash it out
But stay passive, so if they crash, you got a fastened belt (Huh)
Lord bless my lineage, let me be the skinniest
Let me get some time with him, let him know who Kenny is
Children born in one's youth are like arrows in the hands of a warrior
Well, I got an extendo with a long nose like Phineas
Kids proud like Penny is
BeBe & CeCe, I need like 20 twins
Got her in my family like Indian
Feel it in your gut like when you uppercut Ballchinians
Speakin' of guts, hers pokin' out like Winnie in the red shirt
I don't have to teach you a lecture about how sex works
I found out diamonds make pressure
I used to dive headfirst, just know I had to let go of the flesh first
It's true, God, this union was for You, God
We standin' at the stoop, we want to make it to the rooftop
You told us bring some people through, we tried to bring a few, God

My baby was my cry me rivers and shadow casting
Who could be my lovely, my lovely?
Who could be my only one, my only?
I'm almost just as empty as you think I am, a penny for your thoughts
A witty pear of happiness, a pretty Ricky Ross
A maid black music, I woke up in my sympathy, became black Judas
All my everythings for sale
All my secondhand discoveries, Dungarees faded pale
All my halfway hallelujahs that tippy-toed in the mail
All the fluctuations on scales
And the missing therapy sessions of bullets treating me well
Well, we don't drink that
If it ain't the top shelf, nigga you can keep that
Shared my life on Telefone, room 25 and 306, and 809 became my home
Gave you a taste of my redemption and now I want my drink back
Somebody hold me like I'm almost enough
Somebody told me pray for heaven, saw how tiny it was
Little love from me, we can build this home alone
Alone
Forever with you, forever with you
I'm a home away from home hold me and promise you'll keep this secret

Hey, I gotta dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So if it's 'bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

Cole, walk with a nigga, I give you my pain
So much on my mind, I wonder how it fit in my brain
Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart
Life can't get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off
'Cause I still don't see hope, lookin' for a quick fix
When everyone I see is broke, get lost in weed smoke
Knowin' it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably
Barely trustin' niggas, over a decade they been knowin' me
Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got em'
They say he wouldn't leave me, yet I'm fallin' like it's Autumn
Tell me, what do you do just when you're on your last dollar
And the stress of this mess you in can make your ass holla?
Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?
No longer fightin', now the only thing you grow is old
Or do you flip that fuckin' dollar to a dream?
Whether a scholar or a fiend, watch a pawn become a king
Cole!

Young nigga with his jeans low
Nice guy, just got a mean flow
Never seen rich but he's seen poor
Mr. Dollar and a Dream in case she know

That's all a nigga got
So if it's 'bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream

Yeah, armed and ready, you niggas strung out, you spaghetti
Ya paper, confetti, small time, ya'll on one, I'm on mine
You logged off 'cause I'm online, small talk from small minds
I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town
This where I get my dough
My niggas make sure the money right and then I rip the show
I run the town they tried to call me underground
I spun around like, you wish
Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this
I got the nerds rappin' hard shit, dummies rappin' smart shit
Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit
Play your part, life is but a dream for me
I get a flash of nightmares when niggas scheme on me
It's hard to see my enemies, who infiltrated my team
I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem
That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams
I got that red dot waitin', I'm wastin' your whole regime
I wish a nigga would, boy you can't out-smart me
I let you feel like you the shit, but boy you can't out-fart me
Ya never have it, I know you want what I got
But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not
And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as
But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me
If ya don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay
Man she been workin' too hard, I should send her a bouquet
My goal this year is a real one, gonna stack a million
And as soon as I do, Mama that 9 to 5 is through
And I know I ain't been callin', but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
And all the shit that you been through
My girl and then my brother too
'Cause this life gets hard on this road, yeah it's true
I don't never tell you how much I be stressin', but I do
But I suck it up for who? my fans, and my mans
Who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans
Hoppin' in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes
Gettin' brain from a bitch and thinkin' ""Goddamn, what's her name?""
Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame
And then my other side kick in like, ""Bitch, don't be so fuckin' lame""
Dang, what a life, another day, another night
At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me
Just for those prayin' for me, man I know that y'all worry
But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will

178,180,eminem_groundhog day,"""What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare.""

I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
'Til one day I grew suspicious
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start anew, but ditchin'
Missouri for Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone, put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom, please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitchin’, her rules are Krypton-ite
So the walls, I done lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into 'em, runnin' through the kitchen
Pretendin' to be blind Superman, 'cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into Invisible Kid
Disappear out of sight like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new but different
Music into the picture, and it became my new religion

""I remember it clearly, even today.""

Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Nan
Always itchin' for somethin' to do, was flippin'
Through the radio stations one day
And discovered this DJ who was mixin'
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to The Wizard
You ain't have a fuckin' clue what you was missin'
I'd zone out with my headphones
All I remember doing's wishin' for shoes
Fuck them stupid Pumas, bitch!
It's all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J coolin' system
Made that final manoeuvre to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this
That's how I knew my mission
Little boom box boomin', spittin'
Practicin' numerous writtens
When I'd sit in my room, envisionin' my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit
He'd go cuckoo ballistic, go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed
To do this shit; never quit, too persistent

""Carved an underground empire.""

Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all band together, there ain't no stoppin' this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop, 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin'
You, and you forgot your written
Opportunity knocks once, it ain't knockin' again
It tried ding-dong ditchin' shit, I fuckin' got that bitch in
A headlock, cut off its oxygen, Slim
Is not budgin' like cocksuckin' cinder blocks in the wind
Now I got a pot to piss in
Spot in that top position, koppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin', leg up on the competition
Promisin' complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em
Stompin' 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian, LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle, bitch, I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words
Is loose, but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts – shit, no wonder you're sore losers!
Now where's your poo, birds?
Ooh, no more trippin' in bird shit
Songs of self-empowerment surgin'
Words of encouragement, but discouragin'
The rappers, the rap game's god
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
Since yours ain't workin' out, each verse is
More merciless than the first is
And you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch
To get served, bloodthirst revenge of the nerds, chka

""That you'll not escape my vengeance.""

But the dumpy kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
Word to Uncle Ron, I'm turnin' into a non-humble Don
You blonde dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So start the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Better back away from the front row, get launched
Show you I'm bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo
On the fuckin' Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaats
I'll leave you stretched out like a fuckin' yawn
So mow the fuckin' lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fuckin' up this whole landscape of rap
The G.O.A.T. just ate eight acres, an eighth of that
Was just to make a path
And take it straight to your favorite rapper
Oh, look, my notebook looks smoke-cooked
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
Charred debris floatin' like Oakwood
Was burnin', return of the no good and I won't quit

""And the next thing I know
Something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a blamed...""

And I don't quit, won't change
It's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around, y'all, 'cause you may
See if I popped your head

I'm a monster, mutt
I'ma turn into a monster
I'm a monster, mutt
With my dick in your mouth all day!

""I'm not so sure I want to know from whence it came
But the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing.""",0.56,1,nightmare dictionary tell terrifying dream nightmare use think bad luck superstitious day grow suspicious step crack aunt edna stoop poope group stupid pigeon fly coop michigan start anew ditchin missouri michigan work missouri michigan missouri michigan misery mom stick decision discipline thing wanna listen lex luthor bitchin rule krypton ite wall lose power bitch run runnin kitchen pretendin blind superman supervision super power turn invisible kid disappear sight true magician day uncle ronnie bring new different music picture new religion remember clearly today michigan live grandma nan itchin flippin radio station day discover dj mixin day listen wizard fuckin clue missin zone headphone remember wishin shoe fuck stupid pumas bitch new edition troop ll cool j coolin system final manoeuvre mile hoover future know mission little boom box boomin spittin practicin numerous written sit room envisionin dream come fruition remember proof visit wait play new shit cuckoo ballistic roof shit know instant touch mic exist shit quit persistent carve underground empire start group misfit proof proposition band stoppin shit come alias bipolar opposite ready come sharp precision diss shop catch slippin spot rippin forgot write opportunity knock knockin try ding dong ditchin shit fuckin bitch headlock cut oxygen slim budgin cocksuckin cinder block wind pot piss spot position koppin opposition lookin dog pissin leg competition promisin complete dominance sugar ray robinson league muhammad ali colleague bombin probably end stompin ndamukong russian ukrainian ladainian tomlinson flow vomit face competitor fall waist spit rhyme spit rhyme face time place battle bitch mind state step wine grape cry baby maybe way use word loose turds better careful choose feeling scar egos bruise bad truth hurt shit wonder sore loser poo bird ooh trippin bird shit songs self empowerment surgin word encouragement discouragin rapper rap game god james todd wordsmith let word lift got bar dumbbell workin merciless wear shoe shirt bitch serve bloodthirst revenge nerd chka escape vengeance dumpy kid ear dumbo word uncle ron turnin non humble don blonde dumb hoe got dick come blow start need drum roll fore better away row launch big dikembe mutumbo fuckin jumbotron juggernaut wanna rumble bomboclaat leave stretch fuckin yawn mow fuckin lawn ass blade grass fuckin landscape rap g.o.a.t. eat acre eighth path straight favorite rapper look notebook look smoke cook flow stand foot flame stove soot char debris floatin oakwood burnin return good quit thing know come crawl godzilla look blame quit change groundhog day crowd pop head monster mutt going turn monster monster mutt dick mouth day sure want know come white flesh creature trail easily follow shimmer veil light ivory skin slug thing

Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up

Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She'll never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowin' when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wan' let her down

And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without

Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance

Even a nigga running through bitches on tour
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit?""

Every time you out, you come back she poutin'
Sleeping back to back, this is whack, we 'bout
To go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of your guilt and she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evenin'

Listen, even though my ego low, achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me, ""Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color they face is""
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, 'cause you
Know your wifey loves you, thus you refuse to accept it
That’s the type of shit that turned my granny light-skinned

Only difference is we all slaves now, the chains concealed

1001,1021,billy joel_the river of dreams,"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know
The river is wide
I walk down every evening
And I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out
What I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't
Want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is
That I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never
Been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire
I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams

Copped a Range Rover, my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy, I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say: ""I see you""
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do
If a hater snatch your chain, I bet it still won't free you

And acted like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
To buy a crib that's gated 'til hundred racks, I gave it up

I need you to love me (Chaining day), love me (Ohh, my chaining day)
I need you to love me (My chaining day), love me
My last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (Love me, love me, hey hey)
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear (Love me, love me)

Lord, this is the last time (hehe)
Told my accountant, ""It's the last time
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said that shit last time
But this the last time""
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my chains from me
This the last time
'Cause I chose this slavery

Don't take my chains from me

Adrenaline shoots your nerves to the sky
Everyone knows this town is gonna blow
And it's all gonna blow right now
Now you can smash all the windows that you want
All you really need are some friends and a rock
Throwing a brick never felt so damn good
Smash more glass
Scream with a laugh
And wallow with the crowds
Watch them kicking people's ass
But you get to the place
Where the real slavedrivers live
It's walled off by the riot squad
Aiming guns right at your head
So you turn right around
And play right into their hands
And set your own neighborhood
Burning to the ground instead

Tomorrow you're homeless
Tonight it's a blast
Get your kicks in quick
They're callin' the national guard
Now could be your only chance
To torch a police car
Climb the roof, kick the siren in
And jump and yelp for joy
Quickly, dive back in the crowd
Slip away, now don't get caught
Let's loot the spiffy hi-fi store
Grab as much as you can hold
Pray your full arms don't fall off
Here comes the owner with a gun

Cops in helmets line the lines
Shotguns prod into your bellies
The trigger fingers want an excuse
Now
The raging mob has lost its nerve
There's more of us but who goes first
No one dares to cross the line
The cops know that they've won
It's all over but not quite
The pigs have just begun to fight
They club your heads, kick your teeth
Police can riot all that they please

He stepped on the gas and got ghost on 'em
His bitch scream like she seen one
He said, “Shut up while I speed up”
She said, “I think you lost 'em,"" now he think he lost 'em
Now he lost his train of thought
The voice in his head said, “All aboard”

She coked up off of his stuff
And he know it's good
Where the popcorn? This story good, call Hollywood
But anyway, let a nigga get back to it

One got witty
Took his mask off, he a dumbass
Got him on viddy
Somebody yelled out, “Yo, that's 'Chelle”
Blaow, blaow, caught her in the titty, huh

You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire

Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!

Don't fall on my faith, oh (Rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (Look)

Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, ""He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit""
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up

Hopin' that you rappers fall in that

Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)—Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a f*****, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater

Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word to everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone

Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)

But I've been murderin' the game, I'm almost out of victims
This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons
I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though
Shit bro, would you give it all up for these nymphos?
I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?
Half-man and half-amazin', but that's just me bein' modest
I'm an honest man
My mama told me never put it on the lotto and
I work for everything I get, that is my motto, fam
So when I die, these bitches still can fuck my hologram, goddamn

And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that...

(Time flies)
Watch as time go
(Time flies)
Time moves, time flows
(Try to catch it, time flies)
How do we handle these things?
(Time flies, try to catch it)
I am time, we are time and we have control
One thing we need to remember
Is that we are all in this together

Yeah
You can't expect the unexpected, these dreams I manifested
From my head into reality, they seem a bit excessive, but
I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings
All the times that I've been reckless with a ego big as Texas
Thinkin', ""I'm the man""
I never let these hoes inside the plan
My room for bullshit in the crib small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk the path where only giants stand
I am the fire man, shit, I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone
On the road, even though I know they need me at home
Keep my control
From a city where it's freezin' and cold
Each to their own
Punches like this prolly beat up Stallone

And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride (Yeah)
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that...

(Time flies)
One day, we will
(Time flies)
We will find
(Try to catch it, time flies)
We will conquer, conquer with love
(Time flies, try to catch it)
While time is on our side
Continue to hold to those beautiful memories
They won't be here forever, but our spirit lives on

And I dream
That I'm free

And I'm back on the reef where I throw my net out into the sea
All the fine jainas come swimming to me
They hold me and they promise me things
And when the tides high, I cry like a little baby
Don't give me no right kinda love, no Sunday morning
Don't want no puppy lovin'

I wan' rock with you

All a lie, gotta contact home
Gotta contact my baby girl
But a wood never could get up
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
With myates and the eses, yes, they're steady on the fall
I'll be damned if a man with a shank in his hand will make me feel
I feel a Bati man
And I know, that I'm there, someday

Back on the reef where I throw my net out into the sea
All the fine jainas come swimming to me
Hold me, baby, promise me
With no protection on my erection I won't get no V.D
Don't give me no right kinda love, no Sunday morning
I don't want no puppy lovin', g'wan

Gave her a million reasons that she should come along
Immediately, she dropped her shit
But everywhere I go, they told me, ""Watch yo bitch!""

At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages

Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate

'Cause only in still water we can see our faces (See our faces)
Real shit, I told my nigga

""Boy, you better watch them hoes when you sleepin'
Nigga, them dog-ass hoes be creepin'""
I got a few Ms put up for safe keepin'
Long hair, don't care like I was raised in a teepee
Nigga, gun hurt, Nina said she 'bout to go streakin'
Niggas 'bout to go to missin', niggas 'bout to go to deacons
Niggas 'bout to get high as airmen from Tuskegee
Niggas blind to the fact 'cause they don't wan' see me
Niggas don't want talk, niggas don't want reason
Niggas don't want peace, niggas don't know the meanin'

Tomorrow is what a nigga ain't guaranteein'
New Orleans had a sheriff by the name of Harry Lee
And when he died, niggas shouted out, ""Tha-thank you, Jesus""
Cruising down the street and I ain't Caribbean
Ain't terrified and I ain't never been
Sippin' H-Town, lookin' like Jeremy Lin
I'm movin' slower than a fuckin' Maryland terrapin
I ain't got time, patience very thin
I will fuck a nigga bride on the day she marry him
I'm a bad Samaritan, I'm a black American
Got white like a fuckin' Aryan, and

I don't need no pot to piss in, I just need a pot to whip it
I don't need no fuckin' help, I don't need no Scottie Pippen
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper, nigga
Graveyard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no

Now beam me up Scotty
You gon' find your mommy chopped up in a tub
With ""Stop snitchin'"" written on a note by her body
I picked up your ho and she wore something tiny
I wore something simple, she like that about me
My dope from the '90s, my dope ain't consignment
My coke ain't that diet, I hope you a client
These hoes be relying, these niggas be lying
These niggas who snitchin' we throw to the lions
Ain't no testifyin', you know desert's quiet
So scream until you give your throat laryngitis, we so terrorizin'
You cuddle too much, you choose hoes to confide in
I know where you hide and that ho verified it
I told my homie, ""I know where to find him""
He said, ""You late, we already got him
And by the way, it was an honor""
That made my day, made me so proud
I bought my bitch some shit from her favorite designer
And a Chihuahua
What's the occasion? Don't worry about it
I don't fuck with snakes except Kobe, the Mamba
Might cut off my hair 'cause these hoes is Delilah's
Let me check my wallet, my pulse and my vitals
Call me the greatest or call me retired
It's up in the air like carbon monoxide
Bitch, we in the buildin', we started from outside
My dick is my third eye and she call it cockeyed
My bath tub lift up, my walls do a 360
She get so wet, it can be sea sickening
Niggas expect some sort of leniency
I'm in high def, but why are you screening me?
I'm Weezy F you, with a sick dick
Hop on my skateboard, do a quick trick
Playin' my role, even with a thick script
Waitin' on a revolution, hope I get a big tip
Smoking on Cee-Lo Green, lighting up a big gift
Every bud get nipped, life is so vibrant and the suns just trip
Anything can happen, put the whats with the ifs
But what's with the ifs?
Just pass that weed like flyin' colors
Light green, teal, turquoise, purple
When I'm in a room, if these walls could talk
I'm sure they'd prefer to be non-verbal
Papa was a rolling stone, worthless
Mama said I wasn't on purpose
That's why I got a ice box where
My heart used to be in this cold world
I'm a monster, a cold blooded monster
I'm colder than fuckin' Moscow, kilos, ounces, GRAMMYs, Oscars
Knock you off your fuckin' high horse

Please don't let them Dixie muthafuckas put that flag up

And I don't give a damn, muthafucka cause you know why

You try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene
You hairy bastard, work a little bit faster
Because of the shit that I done been through, I shall never call you master

So stay up out the rain, it's beginning to smell like dog, yeah
I wonder how you would be acting if youse in my shoes
You'd probably shit your tight ass draws cause I got a short ass fuse

And be back home before my mom could freak out
We 'bout all the things that we said we was
Fem do everything that he says he does
My mind was different 16 put down the Quran
Start chasing dimes and petty crimes
Either way, it’s sacrilegious
Bad intentions disguised by good decisions
Stay studious used that to dodge suspicion
These the things that had made us dangerous
Been knew how to move, knew all the angles
Can’t judge nobody none of us is angels
Always strings attached, not focused on getting tangled

Yo, this type of shit happens every um, once in a while
You know I won't front with the style
Bring life to the party like a woman and child
From the land of the humble and proud, summers is wild
Ah! Made the unmade-able
Ah! Go to parties I'm paid to go
Me and cuzzo talked the hustle
About doing good business like Rick and Russell

Grimmin' every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
‘Cause I'm mentally rearrangin' his face
I need a change of pace
‘Cause the pace I'm workin' at's dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey
And started slowly roastin' 'em
‘Cause that's where most of my anger is based

I just wanna hurt you—aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes, and the Drakes

I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm goin' all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is, I'm strapped for battle

Leanin' on the horn, screamin', ""Fuck the police,"" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin
So who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
And crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him, and I'm nuts
Then again, who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (evil grin)
(Evil twin) please come in; what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear, and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney
Jeez, just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
‘Cause I'm so sick of bein' the truth
I wish someone'd finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, LMFAO, no way, Jo-
-se Baez couldn't beat this rap—O.J., no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, hey ho (Hey ho!)
I sound like I'm tryna sing the fuckin' chorus to ""Hip Hop Hooray""
No, I’m hollerin', you got bottom-end like an 8-0-8
And I (base) whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so
Let your low-end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho? Slow dancin' or bowling?
You tryin' to hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm lookin' for romance ‘cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke ‘cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
‘Cause we are the same

1213,1235,common_black america again,"Here we go, here, here we go again
Trayvon'll never get to be an older man
Black children, they childhood stole from them
Robbed of our names and our language, stole again
Who stole the soul from black folk?
Same man that stole the land from Chief Black Smoke
And made the whip crackle on our back slow
And made us go through the back door
And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots
Leaving our own to lay in a box
Black mothers' stomachs stay in a knot
We kill each other, it's part of the plot
I wish the hating will stop (war!) and the battle with us
I know that Black Lives Matter, and they matter to us
These are the things we gotta discuss
The new plantation, mass incarceration
Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids
As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is
Is it a felony or a misdemeanor?
Maria Sharapova making more than Serena
It took Viola Davis to say this
The roles of the help and the gangstas is really all they gave us
We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Cory Bookers
The salt of the Earth to get us off of sugar
And greasy foods; I don't believe the news
Or radio, stereotypes we refuse
Brainwashed in the cycle to spin
We write our own story, black America again

You know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is lettin' a person feel that they're important. And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from…

Hot damn, black America again
Think of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind
The color of my skin, they comparing it to sin
The darker it gets, the less fairer it has been
The hate the hate made, I inherited from them
But I ain't gon' point the finger
We got anointed singers, like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie
Need to hear them songs sometimes to believe me
Who freed me: Lincoln or Cadillac?
Drinkin' or battle raps? Or is it Godspeed that we travel at?
Endangered in our own habitat
The guns and dope, man, y'all can have it back
As a matter of fact, we them lab rats
You build the projects for, now you want your hood back
I guess if you could rap, you would express it too
That PTSD, we need professionals
You know what pressure do, it make the pipes bust
From schools to prison, y'all, they tryna pipe us
Tell your political parties invite us
Instead of making voting laws to spite us
You know, you know we from a family of fighters
Fought in your wars and our wars
You put a nigga in Star Wars, maybe you need two
And then, maybe then we'll believe you
See black people in the future
We wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya
We hold these truths to be self-evident
All men and women are created equal
Including black Americans

You know, you know, you know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is to let a person feel like somebody. And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from…

There were some things that people never needed to know
This is one that you keep, that you bury so deep
No one can tear it out

'Cause you're following a code of silence
You're never gonna lose the anger

There's nothing that you have to hide

It's a time-honored resolution
Because the danger is always near

Neighbors smell the perfume, smoke in my room
And I got the door closed, can't be sure, though
Amsterdam weed, spendin' euros
Get the herb rolled, let's relax
Take your shoes off and kick it back
We escape the world, escape the stress
But I don't give a fuck if the house a mess
'Cause we gon' handle that later, we gon' handle that later
Right now, let's get this paper and smile for all them haters
Ayy, cream cheese and a bagel
Have a glass of milk and an Eggo
I'm rockin' PJs and no shirt
I smoke weed, eat yogurt
Enjoy the best things in your life
'Cause you ain't gonna get to live it twice (Twice)

56,56,drake_30 for 30 freestyle,"Yeah

Never thought I'd be talkin' from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I'll say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together (6)
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flyin' over Chattanooga, out here tryna spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google, yeah
Back in the city, shit is gettin' brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle, then take a girl to the movies
They been droppin' out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghostride
The pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just makin' moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concernin'
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin'
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready case we need to retire your jersey, yeah
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championship celebrations durin' regular season
Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Aw, nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to ""Closer to My Dreams""
Wide-eyed and uneducated at nineteen
I can't rap like that, all young and naïve
Not after all the shit I seen and the things I believe
Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
Four thousand square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother
The season start and I don't wanna see you end up with nothin'
Y'all throw the word ""family"" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin'
They knees give out and they passin' to you all of the sudden
Now you the one gettin' buckets
They put they arm around you, now you becomin' the crutches
Kids got on your number 'cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you
Or convince you that they care and see where it goes from there, but
These ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The hate is just bringin' me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie, then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep the shit to ourself
Papi champú, young Pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I
Was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I.

Alright I want you to hear somethin'
I'mma play somethin' for you alright?
Alright, alright
Yo yo you hear it bro?
Yeah

Yeah
Alright listen, listen
Let me tell you what shit is like right now y'all

What's life like now, tryna figure out
They put this mic on trial cause he be killin' now
Forever bitin' my forbidden style
Been laying low for a minute in the game
Since I came all these niggas lookin' timid
My light could never dimith, the Lord is my shepherd
Jesus woke a devil in him since sinnin' with least effort
Thinking back to those lefferts days
And I ain't been the same since I left 6th grade
My mind strayed, used to have the biggest heart
Taking walks with abuela in the park, I used to tell her
I'ma grow propellers one day and be a good fella
Play the hero or whoever, the hood gon' tell us
Let's just pray it ain't the villain
Till then I be feeling some way
Thinkin' I can get the Maybach off gun play
Instead I let the words play with 90 beats a minute
Bet the streets lose a heart beat before the verse finish
But life goes on, basic rules still apply
Bet you can feel that line in any hood you live by
From Flatbush to Figg side, I was a schoolboy too
Hoppin' trains, I just missed my Q

And what's life like for me, it's but a dream
Everything ain't what it seems, up underneath
The surface is but a screen, we only see
What we know
And what's life like for me, it's but a dream
Everything ain't what it seems, up underneath
The surface is but a screen, we only see
What we know

And what's life like now, I can't figure out
They put my mans on trial, say he a killer now
Conspiracies, we gon' get you out
Just keep ya head up G, shit is wild
It's bugged out cause I know you tryna see your child
But I'mma hold you down still cause you my brother
I just gave Will a lil' somethin' for your baby mother
But don't stress, know you caught up in some b.s
Bet next time you see us, we gonna be our best
Love you my nigga, word is bond, you'll stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
Peace to all my brothers who keep still holdin' on
Been away so long, feel like a tickin' time bomb
The misjudgment of my kind, whom the odds is against
Put our backs on the fence, so we self defence
Followed by a series of unfortunate events
Looking like white America got a brother again

And what's life like for me, it's but a dream
Everything ain't what it seems, up underneath
The surface is but a screen, we only see
What we know
And what's life like for me, it's but a dream
Everything ain't what it seems, up underneath
The surface is but a screen, we only see
What we know

Take shots to the face with no peace of mind
Give me my piece of mind
Take shots to the face with no peace of mind
Give me my piece of mind
This life is all we know, this life is all we know

1127,1148,mac miller_kickin incredibly dope shit intro,"When you're young, not much matters
When you find something that you care about, then that's all you got
When you go to sleep at night, you dream of music
When you wake up, it's the same thing
It's there in your face, you can't escape it
Sometimes when you're young
The only place to go is inside, that's just it
Music is what I love
Take that away from me and I really got nothing
Hah-hah
This shit right here, this feel like a million bucks
Jerm, make sure I'm coming through clear here
Most Dope, what it is?
Ladies and gentlemen, you are now in tune to K.I.D.S., uh

See my people and they hands is up
Yeah, the game a girl, trying to tease, but don't plan to fuck
My older brother told me that I'm finally manning up, 'cause
I've been a fuckup, if you ask me
But I'm still praying that my teachers gon' pass me
Letters from my soul, scriptures from the Torah
Only give you what you like, I'm a station on Pandora
Rock a sag, my girl tell me pull my shorts up
Rock solid, homie, I'm built Ford tough
Sip a little lean, smoke a little weed
We just trying to keep it cool, so we blast the AC
Some people hate, we tell 'em it's all gravy
Yeah, you got your team, but I'm fighting with the navy
Battle to the top
We in it to win it, we won't stop
No more going to stores, but don't cop shit
Never go another day with empty pockets
Houston, you there? We balling like the Rockets
And now these eyeballs dropping out they sockets
High honor roll, but not thinking 'bout a college
Love with these rhymes, want the cover of Time
Man of the Year, got my image stuck in your mind
Hold up one second
Girl, this my last L, I'ma roll it up with you
Cop some brand new shoes, put me in a good mood
I'ma bring a couple homies, you can call a couple friends
Is there a type of alcohol that you would recommend?
Being young so fun, I don't ever want to age
Haven't came down in the past five days

And I just want to say one thing

Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
I don't think y'all heard me
I just wanna say Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
Can y'all dig that?
Now when arrows don't penetrate, see (Cupid grabs the pistol)
Uh, yeah, now, now lookie here
He shoots straight for your heart, now, and he won't miss you
But that's alright, y'all won't believe in me anyway, but

Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs
No, thank you, Easter Bunny
There's all this talk about Santa Claus, but see
Love will rule supreme

Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
You got it, when Cupid knocks at your door (You can't ignore me)
There's no need to run
So, Happy Valentine's Day, hey (Every day the 14th)
Now I may have it all wrong, see
If you know what love means, well
Well, somebody tell me
'Cause they just don't believe in me

Ya won't believe in me

No, thank you, Easter Bunny
There's so much fuss about Santa Claus, but see
Cupid will not be defeated

Happy Valentine's Day, every day the 14th
Now, I know your hearts have grown cold
And that bothers me
Now, I understand, 'cause I used to be a bad boy in my day
I know you tryin' to protect your lil' feelings
But you can't run away
Ho-oh

Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy
Hey, don't you supposed to be
Some kind of player, or something?
Bunny

Well, keep on running, player
'Cause I got my good shoes on
And I got 'em tied up tight
So you gon' find out tonight

Got a sweet lil' darlin' back in my corner
Below, I know I love her, but act like I don't want her
Surrounded by the lovely, but yet, feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor the way I give up my heart
But never know because, shit, I never tell her
Ask me how I'm feeling, I'd holla that it's irrele–
I don't get myself caught up in the Jello jella
And pudding pops, that others opt to call falling in love
But for the record, have you ever rode a horse?
Like for you to send me to Pluto, I said, ""Of course!""
But if you ain't a sweety, indeedy, I won't endorse
Han Solo 'til I'm hit by the bullet, so may the force
Be with you and I'll hit you when better time permits
For now, show me samples, examples why you're the shit
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?
And if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?

You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side, they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around

Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

When you asked me if I cheated, I said never (No way)
What are you willing to do to stay together? ('Gether)
How many times we gonna break up for the summer?
How many times you gonna try to call my mother? (Brrr-brrr)
Girl, you're killin' me, I don't wanna act like I can fix this (Fix it, fix it)
I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally, but I can't buy your love

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest, your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Countin' the stars with our last name on the license plate
Woah, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
Set my feelings aside, let's settle down
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around

Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh

If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me

Y'all rice fresh?
Aw, hell nah, you hesitated
Man, anyway, let me get a ten piece lemon pepper, extra crispy
Another ten piece
Man, bitch, I want half and half
Barbecue, don't forget the fries
Oh, lemon pepper, half mild, wet
Add an extra fry too
'Cause y'all be skimpin'
I don't wanna hear none of that shit like y'all did last time, for real
Ayy, add a twenty piece teriyaki
Oh yeah, don't forget any my drinks either

Voodoo man, chicken, bomb, fishscale
If you don't leave now, you will never get there
Tried to go legit, but that shit ain't sit well
I done tried to split your wig, but don't split hairs
My bitch thick, good hair and good skin care
Call the other line and dip, my hoes sit well
Probably 'cause of promises that don't get here
I'ma talk to God so much when I get there

One time, one time for your baby moms
Two time for the hand in the candy jar

Lump in your throat, feel like a trachea, oh dummy

You wide open, you start smokin' with your girl
She nigga-bashin', sayin', ""You don't need em in your world, niggas all dogs!""
If niggas all dogs, then what you call broads?
Felines in heat, meowin for some yarn balls
Now you and her done got to drankin'
Oh now it's really crunk, cause y'all silly drunk and your girl done got to thinkin'
She talkin bout, ""Girl you look so beautiful""
You say, ""thank you,"" bein' nice, you try to change the subject
Want some beans and rice? But she's back at you like a pit
Mixed with a chihuahua, how much meaner can you get?
Don't let her have her way with you, she's gonna have a fit
You're the candy apple of her eye and bout to get bit
Here's what you do -- you
Grab her by her neck, throw her on the wall
Say, ""Bitch don't ever disrespect me, never not at all""

I want ya, fuck flowers
The ceremony starts from the shower with the water
I got somebody's daughter in the Doctor headquarters, chillin
Prepare for this sex drillin, she said somethin in Spanish
Got me feelin mannish, me and you fin' ta vanish
Real quick, feel this shit, got cheese, tryin to make cheese
To get you pregnant overseas

They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, ""Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?""
They said, ""Fucking right, they were the first to go""
It's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With ""I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you""
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year

Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home

Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done

How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?

And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home

Uh, but believe I remember it all

My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say ""What up, though?""
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love
'Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home

Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now

But I'm using a maneuver, keep on moving 'em aside
I'm just trying to make some music for the ride
Listen to it when you drive, destination, you arrive

Got talent, imagine what I'll do with some time
I'm giving you a high feeling, moving your spine

I'm so happy when you mad, Khakis, let 'em sag

Zoom by, don't fasten my seatbelt

See my niggas tryna eat, eat whatever’s on your plate
Save some for me, the worst things in life come sitting six feet
Tryna hop the gate to heaven ‘cause I couldn’t get a key
But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back ‘cause these stripes ain’t free
We still wading in the water, cocaine, blunts, marinating in the water
Leina took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell ‘em talk is cheap, niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust, leave the praying to my momma though
Another motherfucker out of control
Just walking my soles low, lit up with the abuse
They wasn’t for show, I promise every pistol was used
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day, bare faced, giving niggas the blues
Nigga who you? They know me on the streets where I grew

How it took so long to implement all things that you told me and showed me
Consoled me And for you to know me, but only as some one who is broken
And not someone who felt more lonely more times than not
First habit was not open up but bury the lock
Crazy thing I’m gon be with someone doing all the things that you told me to
And someone gonna love you like you deserved to
Be at least, At least we both know it won’t be me at least
You know we tried, well we tried something at least
Even if it fell back on me at least
I know that somebody would be a better man than I could be at least
I mean at times I still wanna hit ya line and check how you doing
But I know that’s not really the right way to do it
Plus you won’t be around for too much long, man you probably gone be moving
To a place to pursue the passions and crafts you been doing
You was always over the city anyway, Anyway
I’m proud of you up in advance, and thank you again
For letting me have you even though I had tweaked again, and let slip through my hands
But then again maybe I didn’t
And this was just the end and the reality is you was built for another man
Maybe in another life we were just friends
Maybe in this life in different circumstance, it could happen again

This ain’t none of that song
This is a thank you for loving me

This a thank you for helping me find myself song

Helped you like the pieces of you I had you helped me
Hope you see yourself becoming the woman you wanna be, no thanks to me
I hope no hate for me, not to make me feel any better but you don’t wanna waste that energy on things you don’t need
This a song to say thank you for supporting all my dreams
Sometimes being more excited for things than me for things I would achieve
This is a hope you in your bag song
Reflection on what we had, take the good and the bad song
Wanna let you know that I’m growing now
I pray you with someone who can hold you down everything I put you through I know was wild
But I hope when you think of me, you could at least smile or think that it wasn’t wasted that thing that was on your dial

Chased out with a knife
With a face like Bob Marley
And a mouth like a motor bike

Oh well, the bars are always open
And the time is always right
And if God's good word goes unspoken
The music goes all night
And it goes:

If I were Bob Marley, I'd say ""Could you be loved?""
And If I was Half Pint, or with my Lord, up above
If I was Mike Tyson, I would look for a fight
And If I was a Boomtown Rat, I would be staying up all night
If I was the king Ad-Rock, I would get stupid dumb
If rhymes were Valiums, I'd be comfortably numb
But if I had a shotgun, you know what I'd do
I'd point that shit straight at the sky
And shoot heaven on down for you


I want a lover, but I can't find the time
I want a reason, but I can't find the rhyme
And I want to start some static, but I can't afford
To get slammed to the ground like I fell off my skateboard, hey

Get strapped with protection, or strap with disease

Laughter, it's free
Any time, just call me:

Funky fresh hits
You get nothing

Thirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rain

Roll up, roll out, get mines, dip out

If you would show me how to funk like you do


Deep in pain I called the names
Of some funkified friends of mine
And they were on the road and gettin' it on
And groovin' for hours live

South side, south side
Spread love, spread love, spread love
(south side, souths side, south side)
South side
Inside, outside, up, right, down

Southside 'round 91st and Cottage Grove
I done seen a lot of failures still I found myself a lot of goals
YCA was where I found myself
I started using lead to harness gold
It's way easier to smile, let your local hatin' ass nigga know
Learning patience fast, sippin' slow
All this water in me, I've been water bendin' on the southern side of the 'go
I got martyrs with me, ship is chartered
We've been on a mission, lowkey expedition
Using intuition, losing inhibition just to get
But only inches through the door
To put you on some shit you didn't know
This ain't no poser shit, on some Moses shit
You can see it swimming through the flow
See, I done told you this but gotta show you this
You know actions do a little more
I quit the fantasies and started planting seeds
Tryna usher in a little growth
My nigga we been on our way up, I won't say a lay up
But love is easier than what they show
You should know

And they be asking, ""what do love got to do with the point?""
It’s the soothe in your water, it’s the truth in your joint
All that gold is overrated
What do you do with your coin?
We gon' try to spread some love with it
Spread some love
We gon' try to spread some love, ain't nobody got to know

Not the hate, if you hatin' nigga don't now
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love, spread love, spread love
Spread love

Cause what a nigga really got to say to me, huh?
I just let my little light shine
I guess that's why they wanna throw shade at me, huh?
Cause we'll say, ""I love you"" and never show that shit
That ain't okay with me, try to spread love on the daily
And the recoil like I got a AK with me
I bet the hater shit don't take you far
Breathe, stretch, shake, let it all go like Ma$e wit me
I brought the water in a mason jar
I'm trynna build, that's masonry in the literal sense
Some people got a literal fence around they heart
Mine's on my sleeve, and I'm out here sleeveless
I ain't finna plead with these niggas to fuck with me
I keep it a buck fifty
Tryna follow in the footsteps of Jesus
Hopin' you can keep up with me

The basics of his message was love, the basics just loving yourself and projecting that love onto others
Treat the next man like a brother
And I know it's hard if you know his words
Then you know it's God

But no way they can see in though (Nah)

I’m in your house eatin' carrot-cake
While I sit there and wait and I marinate
I'm irritated, you 'bout to meet a scary fate
And come home to find yourself starin' straight into a fuckin' barrel like Sharon Tate
Raise the concerto while I narrate
Yeah, you be on the straight and narrow like a fuckin' arrow shape

With so much leg-room and air space on this airplane

Life, it will strangle you with bicycle chain
You’re gonna have to come identify the remains

All the windows are busted out and it's like a free-for-all in here and, uh, the owner should at least come down here and see if he can secure his business if he wants to.)
April 26th, 1992
There was a riot on the streets
Tell me where were you?
You were sittin' home watchin' your TV
While I was participating in some anarchy
First spot we hit it was my liquor store
I finally got all that alcohol I can't afford
With red lights flashin', time to retire
And then we turned that liquor store into a structure fire
Next stop we hit it was the music shop
It only took one brick to make that window drop
Finally we got our own p.a
Where do you think I got this guitar that you're hearing today? ey

Homicide, never doin' no time
When we returned to the pad to unload everything
It dawned on me that I need new home furnishings
So once again we filled the van until it was full
Since that day my livin' room's been more comfortable
Cause everybody in the hood has had it up to here
It's getting harder and harder and harder each and every year
Some kids went in a store with their mother
I saw her when she came out she was gettin' some Pampers
They said it was for the black man
They said it was for the Mexican
And not for the white man
But if you look at the streets
It wasn't about Rodney King
Not this fucked up situation and these fucked up police
It's about coming up
And staying on top
And screamin' 187 on a motherfuckin' cop
It's not written on the paper it's on the wall
National guard
Smoke from all around

A heritage of vision
Was given to us all
To smell the rose's fragrance
To hear the songbird's call
To watch the distant moonlight fill
The coming of the tides
To understand that life is more
Than always choosing sides
And some have seen what can be seen
Of sailing ships and kings
And some are given feet of clay
And some are given wings
And some must struggle just to breathe
Some have a golden spoon
And some will never leave the nest
While some walk on the moon
And don't you know the life that lives
Within the silent hills
Is just as rich and beautiful
And just as unfulfilled
As man with all his intellect
His reason and his choice
Oh, who's to say the nightingale
Has any less a voice
The silver dolphins twist and dance
And sing to one another
The cosmic ocean knows no bounds
For all that lives are brothers
The whippoorwill, the grizzly bear
The elephant, the whale
All children of the universe
All weavers of the tale
So palomino lie back down
And dream yourself to sleep
The hawk flies with the morning dove
The lion with the sheep
As far away as you may go
We'll never be apart
It's in your dreams that you will know

Here I am riding along in this ambulance
To the city jail
Going to jail accused of being a peeping tom
Dammit man, I'm saying
Any man would try to find out if his girl
Was doing, doing him wrong
That's all I was doing there outside her home
Oh, I'm a little old country boy
Just a young'un in my teens
I don't gamble, drink or swear
And she did this to me
Mama said son you're going to fall
For that common cajun queen
She's going to take you for your all
And that's what she done done to me
Yodel-la-hee, yodel-la-hee, yodel-la
Yodel-la-hee, yodel-la-hee, yodel-la-hee-hee-hee
Cracked ribs, black eyes and a bloody nose
I've been victimized
I'm the victim of a one-sided circumstance
No one's heard my side
And when you hear my side, you'll see the rotten trick
She pulled on me
How could she, that I loved, do this to me?

And that's what she done done to me
Eee-ha!
Lately, she's been acting fishy all the time
Just like tonight
When we kissed goodnight she pulled away from me
(she had the nerve to pull away from me)
So I hid from sight
Out of sight by her door, I heard her give her love
To another guy
I guess the guy must have heard me cry
He rushed to the door
That's when I screamed, ""Oh lord!""
Oh, I'm a little old country boy
Just a young'un in my teens
I don't gamble, drink or swear
And she did this to me
Mama said son you're going to fall
For that common cajun queen
She's going to take you for your all
And that's what she done done to me
Talk about surprised at her, when she screamed to him
It's a peeping tom--then he beat me up
I took the beating but I felt more hurt when she called the cops
Spitting on twelve months!
Twelve months of loving that girl ain't my idea of a peeping tom
So officer, please let me go, 'cause I've done no wrong
Oh, I'm a little old country boy
Just a young'un in my teens
I don't gamble, drink or swear
And she did this to me
Mama said son you're going to fall

And that's what she done done to me
Oh, I'm a little old country boy

And she did this to me
Mama said son you're going to fall
For that common cajun queen
She's going to take you for your all
And that's what she done done to me
Let this country boy go, officer
Please, now that's all I ask
Take this stick out my back and let me go
I don't need her no more
Oh lord, have mercy
Oh, I'm a little old country boy

As I sit in my b-boy stance
With flip-flops and socks, and sweatpants
I'm finna enhance your brains, check it out

Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the Point didn't have no flow
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walking to the store
Caught a player slipping
But now I lay it to the floor just like carpet
'Cause I got the heat in my baby momma name now
Never bragging just to stay knot
Even when I was a younger lad, I learned my lesson
Never talk to strangers in the trap and answer questions
The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons 'cause we don't sell dope
That you distribute
We don't contribute to your clandestine activity
My soliloquy may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
Two things I hate—liars and thieves; they make my blood boil
Boa constricted, on my soul that they coil

Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel

It took your momma nine months to make it
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it
Cut that kronk clean up, I did, but I did so not safely
Don't want no AIDS, *clapping* no claps, or no rabies
Yeah, we take no shit, like, ummm, stopped up commodes
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand four
But not for long 'cause we got a better sack to serve
Tryna take you other people 'fore your rims at the curb
'Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go 'head, go 'head
More head for me, while you ride to the beat
Drop, like tears, like For Fears, you know
Shout, shout, let it all out, just for my peers
And peoples who feel it's time to unwind
Like December 31st, on nineteen-ninety-nine

Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel

Okay, like this, yes, yes
One time for my boys doing King shit
Two times, too legit and it don't quit
Three times for my folks in the drop top
Four times, OutKast and it don't stop
One time for my girls doing Queen thangs
Dead fresh to the T, eating chicken wings
Three times for my girls in the beauty shop
Four times, OutKast and it don't stop

1767,1797,mick jenkins_prosperity,"Who's the most self conscious?
Lately I've been lookin' at tags less
Never leavin' store fronts bagless
Designer rags and conversations with facists
Mr. Wilder's a myth, theMIND is a gift
I mean, so is this gift
No longer ashamed of my thread count
In bed with a girl who's not ashamed of her headcount
Still I wake up with these cold sweats
If I ever get to sleep at all
Pray this woman fucks me soft
Instant gratification
I mean, now I'm impatient
It's hard for a nigga who never had shit to have shit
You turned into that store front, paper or plastic?
You asked for it
My dad says the Lord's blessings will rain down
I pray I stay sane now
Asking questions like, ""Am I lame now?""
Because I'm still plagued by peer pressure
Craig says ""survivor's guilt will probably still get ya""
Time spent is still like the only real measure
Of the four letter word
I drip my ego in gold
I wear that bitch like a fur
The only protection from the cold stares and moments that I’d rather forget

Big bracelets, Rollies, big faces
Jesus pieces can't save you
VVS is stressin'
Best dressed, say less
When niggas stress it ain't true (Fuck, bro)
Cuban links and pinkie rings and trinkets
Diamonds, bling and gold, all in my grill...grill...

Spread love
Fuck a dollar
Fuck your lover, get some head-love
Break bread with your niggas, burnin' bed bugs
Cause you don't need that
Fuck a zippy nigga feedback
We gone where the keys at
You see, I'm only ever lost when I ask where the trees at
Milly rockin' through the pressure
Middle fingers to the pessimistic
Niggas lashin' cause they simply missed the message, listen
All this gold I be talkin', what's it representin'?
If I ain't rockin' what I'm talkin'
What I'm talkin' really
Mostly metaphor
Most niggas out here talkin' silly
""Well talk about it, Mick""
Lot of people like to dance around a point, I couldn't even bust a waltz around it
I've been tryna make one
See a chance startin', I'ma take one
Only mobbin' with my day one niggas
Only shoppin' for like 15 minutes in a different city
When I'm on tour
More contemporary than a war tour, not a label whore
I don't play with niggas
Talkin' color palettes, seein' silhouettes
You see me takin' pictures
I'ma build on that
And it don't matter, I'ma chill on that
You can see it when you see me
I'ma always be me
I can keep it real like that

Big bracelets, Rollies, big faces
Jesus pieces can't save you
VVS is stressin'
Best dressed, say less
When niggas stress it ain't true (Fuck, bro)
Cuban links and pinkie rings and trinkets
Diamonds, bling and gold, all in my grill...grill...

OK, the love of money root of all evil
OK, the camel through a eye of a needle 'fore a rich man
Before a rich man know heaven
So I'm in this bitch, no wrist band
Movin', dippin', dodgin' through the temptation
I've been hasty, I be patient
I've been maybed to be never heard from again
So when I got the cash
I be spendin' like we savin'
Say, ""he trippin'"" till you check my balance
10 years later you can check my talents
I done doubled up from a 2-4 from 5-10
I never been no type of man to hide his shit beneath the dirt
Crack a smile beneath the hurt
You can only do that when you knew that
All those things that you had when you was up was just stuff
Without it it's like, Kith, its Just Us
Who are you when no one's lookin'?
Most niggas crooked, they money exposed
It's always sunny until it's cloudy
And then you suppose
That that door to the boat, will still be open when you reach it
Hope it work out like that for you
I wouldn't bet on that myself though

I figure before the first gun blast, they know who gon' win
Now won't that make us all fools, like class clowns
Praying Private Ryan comes 'round
Sound travels at one-thousand-one-thirty feet per second
Niggas in the street they want it, hurry
When niggas stop biting that's when 3000 starts to worry
A little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray Murray
Answer quick: do you know what desire is? (Huh?)
Apparently not, that's why you get what you got
Now answer this: do you know what fire is? (Yeah!)
The body of hot, the motivator of pots
Snot, spit, shit are characteristics of release
Ask your niece or nephew, you think we left you
What the future holds in its sweaty palms
Think I'm finna vom'?
You move it like you mean it, she'll come

White blood cells to the common cold rebel

To brainwash me to be a commercial clown
Fuck that, I see the way you were
See the way you smirk
I'm catching you where you work
God only knows all the trouble that grows
Deep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes
Can I blast those who point the finger at me
Who criticize and talk shit so freely
Fuck XXL—you're a size too small
I should hire Eminem so we can kill you all
Whether you live to talk shit about the Real
Then kiss my ass in person how much you love the Hill
I'm the outcast coming to blaze the grass
Outlaw due to my life that's come to pass
Dré, pass me the glass of wine
So I can pour it over my homies grave and mine
For all those who fallen and answered when God was calling
Jump into my ragtop and get all in
I'm the bomb, planted in your car—why you frozen?
Pop the tape in ignite the explosion
The world is mine, the world is yours, the world is ours
The world is lost, the world is tossed

Your homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin' clean-up, so it worsens
People and persons on the opposite teams, oh, yes, its curtains
No bullets burpin', oh, just lyrically twerking, oh
Making a statement when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state
It's kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day

Got this thang licked like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps
Making that music that make your neck hurt

Six woofers and four amps

Across deep blue skies she would soar
Leaving her engravement
And everything sunk its stress
But for my drunken mess
And if the pain compress
Then it's something less to explain

I felt this fear before
I miss my best ailment
Bruising on my right side feels so
With thoughts of her displacement
And if there was nothing left
But for this strange deep rest
And the screams from my chest
Well, this heart's got no escape

And it all falls back into place
The prisoner's skull
The prisoner's brains
Were beat to a pulp

Western Oklahoma nineteen forty three
I always felt grateful to live in the land of the free
I gave up my father to South Korea
The mind of my brother to Vietnam
Now there's a banker who says I must give up my land
There are four generations of blood in this topsoil
Four generations of love on this farm
Before I give up I would gladly give up my right arm
What are we making weapons for
Why keep on feeding the war machine
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies
Take it away from the hands of the poor
Tell me, what are we making weapons for
I had a son and my son was a soldier
He was so like my father, he was so much like me
To be a good comrade was the best that he dreamed he could be
He gave up his future to revolution
His life to a battle that just can't be won
For this is not living, to live at the point of a gun
I remember the nine hundred days of Leningrad
The sound of the dying, the cut of the cold
I remember the moments I prayed I would never grow old
What are we making weapons for
Why keep on feeding the war machine
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies
Take it away from the hands of the poor
Tell me, what are we making weapons for
For the first time in my life I feel like a prisoner
A slave to the ways of the powers that be
And I fear for my children, as I fear for the for the future I see
Tell me how can it be we're still fighting each other
What does it take for a people to learn
If our song is not sung as a chorus, we surely will burn
What are we making weapons for
Why keep on feeding the war machine
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies
Take it away from the hands of the poor
Tell me, what are we making weapons for

Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like ""Billie Jean"", but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time
And all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothin' like the new times
Now it's rough times, I'm out here on front lines
Just tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breakin' my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry 'bout whose house you live at
Or who loves you more or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got here
Nah, look, I'm too proud
To let that come between me and you now
Realize I gotta think for two now
I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some Mod Rosé and the Baccarats out
For our cheers to the next generation
But this Champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit
But man, you know
I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably coulda did stand-up
Yeah, but at the same time he's a stand up
And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony's sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hundred more
Sorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks, you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this
Me and your mother will have come around
Instead of always cuttin' each other down
God willin', I got a good feelin'
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this my G

I'm changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone

254,257,saba_monday to monday,"Honestly I think that 24/7 a understatement to my day to day
If ain't no way then imma make way
Naysayers say it ain't no way
I ain't never listen
Kept em at a distance
This is for the ones who ain't afraid
And this is more than some paper chase
I wonder who else can say the same
Never worried bout what they attain
If I'm living then I really can't complain
Can't contain who you really are
I know my true colors like this ain't a stain
Hustle hard like a MMA hit
Innovative
Didn't do it all in a day spent
But if they did we ain't hating
Look, I go double or nothing I'm just here to gamble
On my grind like my name was Kareem Campbell
Built it from the ground up like I just went camping
My name should be hand in hand with Thor's hammer
Remember when I couldn't afford dinner
Losing weight I'm getting more thinner
Saw it coming like a lesson planner
All the glitz and glamor critically acclimated I grew it on my own my organic
Now my agent say we tour planning
World renown like Michael or Janet
Got it out the ground like growing granite
Gracious I can't take a day for granted
Never looking down and never panicked
Only kept my thought on being great
And that's what I attracted like a magnet

I hustle from Monday to Monday
Knew that I would get it some day
Got me feeling like Lebron James
Wasting time bet that's what some say
Remember when they didn't want me
I knew I was on to something
10 to 10 what my alarm say
A.K.A. Monday to Monday

I'ma put mom in a castle
Got it out the ground like gravel
Coming back around like a lasso
Micro, macro
I'ma put mom in a castle
Got it out the ground like gravel
Coming back around like a lasso
Macro, macro

Like a vision board I see with clarity
I hustle like my name was Gary V
For more than the wealth and prosperity
Accountants was talking bout equity
I'm Triple H giving a pedigree
That mean that I'm special my specialty
I put in the work till I'm dirt in the earth
Or moving furniture to Beverly
I cannot stress it I just let it be
I want it all I am not settling
I'm on the move like I was settling
Failed a few but I ain't sweating it
They say success is like the best revenge
I can't kick it with no pessimist
Know it's my time that ain't tentative
Monday - Monday talking 10 to 10

I hustle from Monday to Monday
Knew that I would get it some day
Got me feeling like Lebron James
Wasting time bet that's what some say
Remember when they didn't want me
I knew I was on to something

The high or the low, boy, just me and my homeboys
The police kill us so we made up our own laws

To do it like nobody has ever done

When I was in seventh grade, my grandfather told me, ""Don't get caught loving the streets, 'cause they never gon' love you back."" But I feel like it's all we got, so it's all we really do love. At the end of the day, I feel like the problem is the people that control it don't really come from here. So they can't do nothing but, you know, look down on us. We look at them, we see somebody that could help; they look at us and all they see is a nigga. But it don't really matter anyway. We all gon' die one day, man. One day.

Do doves cry when a Black man die, or do we croak with crows?
The young catch gunshots, the old catch the Holy Ghost
Ho, I love not, I never seen no pot of gold
Just bar windows and six-fours with no switches
Was broke with no bitches; she love me, though
You'll kill me if it make you richer
What you screaming you my brother for?
Heart is where the hatred is, the brain'll stain the love below
And life is what you make it, so I'm making money for my folks

I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make my momma proud, feel like her only son
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
With everything I need, with everything I want
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To do it like nobody has ever done

When most people look at a person who does what I do, they look at us with these preconceived notions, as if it's a set way for us all to be. But we all people at the end of the day, so I wonder why we don't treat each other like it. You looking at a person, telling them that they story don't matter, really no better than me, walking down the street tryna shoot at somebody. 'Cause all we got is these dreams, man, and y'all ain't never had to not have nothing. And that's the last thing you want for anybody is to not really have nothing at all.

I been through Hell and back, I seen my momma cry
Seen my father hit the crack, then hit the set, then flip the sack
I done seen my homies die, then went on rides to kill 'em back
So how you say you feel me when you never had to get through that?
We live for they amusement like they view us from behind the glass
No matter what we grow into, we never gon' escape our past
So in this cage they made for me exactly where you find me at
Whether it's my time to leave or not, I never turn my back

761,773,99 neighbors_redrum,"My aura gold
Gold soul theory watch ‘em glow
Flow stinging like some paper cuts and lemon juice on open sores
Down the block from Oodie, stolen hoopty at the corner store
Shattered goals, falling like some windows of a broken home

All my women gorgeous, they adore to see a fuck up
Less important then they exes that divorced ‘em
‘Cause they told ‘em they fuckin’ another whore again
Where the fuck this story end?
Stole her mom’s Corolla, drove it off a bridge to torture him
This mornin’ had a cup of coffee at Muddy Waters
Sat across from Diablo he complimented my garment
Said I’m doing fine, had a couple questions on my mind
He said shit, I can't even lie, I’m strugglin’ with mine
He told me in due time everything will be fine
You could always flip your soul for like $9.99
Watch these problems go away and your family will be straight
Just know you’ll never get to see the gold on Heaven’s gates
I said true, but I gotta see what the homies wanna do
He said facts, keep it cool ‘cause both sides are watching you
Ain’t no Yeezy in my Serato to know that I’m a god
This a hip-hop holocaust, a rap homicide
Commit mass suicide ‘cause it’s really do or die
Off some rounds at the boys in blue to watch these pigs fly
Maybe I’m bipolar, this energy always switchin’
‘Cause of fickle niggas itchin’ for digits, beggin’ for listens
Might just stick em, flip the switchblade, poke ‘em and hit ‘em this way
Choke ‘em and kill ‘em, that way they know that I’m different

(Fuck this bitch bruh, I hate her, yo)
Had a conversation with a two faced bitch, she tryna yell at me
For everything she say that I ain’t did, she feelin’ me
Got a couple bottles I can’t chase, it’s killin’ me
Make the drink a little bit stronger, put a pill in me
I think I’m running in these circles again
I try to drown myself in liquor, so I’m swimmin’ again
It’s word to Mac, I’m watching movies while I’m rippin’ this pen
I got the sound off and I’m faded, wake me up when this ends
I think I’m losin’ my friends, I dropped out of this reality
Damn I miss the drugs, but momma proud of me
Never switchin’ up but I don’t know if that shit outta me
Never wanna wake up, rather be down in the ground in peace (uh)
I’m spittin’ cyphers with homies with 99 bars
Take another pill and I’m wakin’ up right behind bars
The 5-0 ain’t my best friend (nah)
And when it’s over, gotta know that my new life starts
I’m rippin’ darts with my demons, he gassin’ up my check
Gotta find some bread like it’s the Eucharist
I be hitting licks and jackin’ shit, so call me counterfeit
Took a quarter shrooms, fuckin’ tweakin’ bout an hour in
Thinkin’ bout the times I never miss
Create a battleship, inside my head
A pyramid to find the journey to this bliss I never knew
Mirrors never truly represent to where I’m lookin' at
Or where I’m gonna get, ayy, yeah

I take a break and hop up back on it, snap up on it
Neo in The Matrix, the way I’m lean ‘em from back to forth
With over orders, over over analyze subordinates
The coordinates is plotted to yo’ front do'
We smack the shit up out you verbally
No need for keyboards
Then check the shows and try to hate
But leave, just tryna see more
I destroy
Everything I’m touchin’, grab that blanket for yo’ comfort
Check yo’ mans, 'cause you’re in trouble
No 10 K, no need for runnin’
All these funds come in double
These is new, so niggas wonder
How I’ve been up on the bubble
And pop, like Drake lyrics
And rock, like Trey singin’
And bop, like Chance bringin’ his songs
Some Dré feelin, on god
The spirit died and rose up through me through the ashes
I’m acid on tongues to people
Who never considered mappin’
This path to a million riches
With nothin’ but voice
And snappin’ on anybody who’s cappin’
Talkin, seeming average
After the I kill the masses on Battlefield
With no casket, I’m comin’ for you and yours
It ain’t safe, and I’m on attack
Your homebase, plotting tactics
No way that you can match us
I’m ravenous, I need everything they tryna go and stash from me
But that’s just talk, and I’ve done enough for these runnas up
To come into the race and still demolish them
Like, ""What it does?"" I’m comin’ up
With newer than the fake from your media

Boxer briefs, pants, pictures of frenemies killing me

We wired the intricacies of our logic, no hands in my pocket

Much of the information that is brought forth, not only from Doctor Mohammed, but other areas, other scholars, are not available to you as a sister said in your curriculum that you've had for 400 years when you did not allow us to read and write, it was being hidden.
Whether you, sir, personally did that or not, it was a legacy that was passed onto you.
And I end by saying the Holocaust is simply the greatest atrocity on film.
Ours was not filmed.

In our old familiar place
You and I, face to face
A bottle of red, a bottle of white
It all depends upon your appetite
I'll meet you any time you want
In our Italian restaurant


Things are okay with me these days
Got a good job, got a good office
Got a new wife, got a new life
And the family is fine
Lost touch long ago
You lost weight, I did not know
You could ever look so nice
After so much time

You remember those days
Hanging out at the Village Green?
Engineer boots, leather jackets
And tight blue jeans
Oh, you drop a dime in the box
Play the song about New Orleans
Cold beer, hot lights
My sweet romantic teenage nights


Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies
And the king and the queen of the prom
Riding around with the car top down
And the radio on
Nobody looked any finer
Or was more of a hit at the Parkway Diner
We never knew we could want
More than that out of life
Surely Brenda and Eddie
Would always know how to survive

Brenda and Eddie were still going steady
In the summer of '75
When they decided their marriage
Should be at the end of July
Everyone said they were crazy
""Brenda you know that you're much too lazy
And Eddie could never afford
To live that kind of life.""
Oh but there we were waving
Brenda and Eddie goodbye

Well, they got an apartment
With deep pile carpets
And a couple of paintings from Sears
A big waterbed that they
Bought with the bread
They had saved for a couple of years
They started to fight
When the money got tight
And they just didn't count on the tears

Yeah, rock and roll!

Well, they lived for a while in a very nice style
But it's always the same in the end
They got a divorce as a matter of course
And they parted the closest of friends
Then the king and the queen
Went back to the green
But you can never go back there again

Brenda and Eddie had had it already
By the summer of '75
From the high to the low
To the end of the show
For the rest of their lives
They couldn't go back to the Greasers
The best they could do
Was pick up their pieces
We always knew they would
Both find a way to get by
And that's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie
Can't tell you more 'cause I told you already
And here we are waving
Brenda and Eddie goodbye

1037,1057,eminem_headlights,"Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's 15 degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, ""Little prick, just leave!""
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

‘Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Momma, for ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, this shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness

I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world

Never seen no ass as large as yours
How much that cost? That's what I call a Roethlissplurge
You drive me bonkers, I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first
Date 'cause I think I gave you power
When I gave you flowers in a vase
A box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs
Probably shoulda never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Shoulda been one of the first signs to cause alert
Man, we jumped in too fast
'Cause since then I just can't be apart from her
'Cause nobody's body's awesomer
I lust her and she loves me 'cause I'm popular

It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight) (Hey!)
('Cause I give in at the sight of her)
And I here I go again

You were obviously oblivious to me
I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from
The beginning, now I'm in disbelief, I
Never knew that this could be such misery, ah
'Cause now you see nothing but me
And I don't see nothing but you
And I'm about to flip 'cause we are – super glued in
We stuck to each other's hips and we can't
Do anything individually, which is to cling on
Scared to be alone, can't specifically describe it
I just can't seem to give a reason
That's definitive, just need ya
Talkin' about I live and breathe ya
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically
Addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you
Don't wanna be with you neither
Bitch, put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek

Don't wanna share you with no one else
""What the fuck you whisperin' for?
You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the
Games behind, your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
I think you need to finish developing a
Little more mentally to get the picture.""

To the crib ever again, no Visa
Not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's

You were usin' me for loot like I used you for looks
Oh, thought you was too good for me, huh?

I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leavin' you, I'm not comin' back
She said, ""The fuck with that!
Where's my Louisville Slugger at?""
She grabbed that fuckin' bat
And swung it at my head, I barely ducked and that's
Right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice

As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
If love is a place I'ma go again

Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave

To puffy winter coats and Christmas mornings
I used to chill with the kids next door
And SpongeBob came around 'bout four
And then I'd hang with Bart's guys
Around the bend was Smart Guy
Flipping through the picture books
Checking through my archives
Remember the old days, the ones you'll never get back
At the end of parties, passing around gift bags
Now we blow entire O's at one kick back
MY$FITS and mismatch that get off like wrist slaps, uhh

Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smile comes through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God
When they reminisce over you, my God

Remember Jeepers and Odyssey Fun World?
Young pimpin' like you oughta see one girl
Mama Jann, mama Charlie, and my mama Lisa
Booster seat used to boost my kitty, Connie's Pizza
And every year we made a Christmas list
And Auntie Linda cooked a Christmas dish
And all of our grandparents made a Christmas wish
Like ""Lord, let me see another year like this"", uhh

Put your motherfuckin’ hands in the air
Or you gon’ need a halo, I’m a mothafuckin’ slayer
This ain’t no game, I’m not no player
Nigga trying to find his way and then he bringing pain, you better know we major
I’m on this water heavy, what’s a little gold and a pager?
Wrestle with these words a young Mick Foley, all I see is AC Slater
These niggas jaded, ‘bout to set it off, I feel like Jada
Still on the block it feel like Jenga how it tumble down
Hands shaking like a Rumble pack, are we humble now?
Buzzing, how we bumble now?
Leaving niggas puzzled, do the right thing and they're buggin’ out
Know the Free don't stop for nothing
Tell ‘em niggas stop the frontin’
Roll in front, so if you ever see teardrop, you better know we choppin’ onions
I’m spitting yellow bricks, we rarely stop for munchkins
That’s why I do not fuck with customs
I’m unaccustomed to these costumes
Know that if you cross the free, it just might cost you
I’m not a doctor or Kevin Costner
The way I’m dancing with these wolves, I pray I never lost a step
I keep it steppin’ nigga; that’s a bet

Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Relax and take notes, relax and take notes, notes, notes, notes

Put your motherfuckin’ hands in the air
And wave them like you just don’t care
I’m just showin’ love to my mothafuckin’ people
You can tell your mans we ain’t going nowhere
Now keep your hands in the motherfuckin' air

Leather loafer steppin’, niggas better watch they mouth now
Leaving loaded lessons, pray for blessings when the doubts ‘round
Thousand Island stretchin’, I ain’t stressin’ no salad
I’m in this water where the sharks be, coming for the same place your thoughts be
Artsy, dirty mouth, I never do the flossing
Hardly, stuntin’ on the niggas that’s frontin’
I know they do not want it, I run over niggas, that’s punnin'
No, I ain’t trying to kick it, I’m cookin’ no bun in the oven
I need it on the stove, push it to the people off a cottage grove
Pot of gold, flooded more than Hollygrove
Mothafuck a Hollywood, never take a holiday, I’m spotting foes
Everywhere, know that I get very rare
Faced the God, what’s up Based God? I’m pacing hot
Tracing opps, know your enemy, control your energy
Don’t slip with niggas that pretend to be, only kin of me
Can call me blood, even a friendly can see the love
We do it for the free and keep it up
Tell your niggas they can keep the hate
Tell my friends I appreciate, the value never depreciate

This for my niggas, who be chillin’ with them killers in the wild
We gettin’ high ‘til we bug the fuck out
It’s been a minute, I’ve been chillin’ on the pile

We get wild if you give us that look
Hit you with the follow up and the right hook
Right, right

Put your fucking hands up in the air
Or you gon' have to lay low when I motherfucking spray ya
This ain’t no game like Sega, don’t be a hero
I’m with my good fellas and we ‘bout to Rob DiNero
Give me the pesos, give me the Euros, give me the dollars
Give me the say so if these niggas want the drama
If I call my partners up, body bags is popping up
Keep popping shit, we pop the trunk, make you niggas popular
Hit him between his oculars, what the fuck is popping, cuz?
Super Saiyan like I opened 47 chakras up
Pussy hoes we knocking up, these flows keep stocking up
As long as I’m rhyming, I'm Ben Wallace on your wallets, uh
My true shottas go blocka, blocka
Soul shocking with the fire, probably light your block up
Stop your blood clot crying, the pussy boy there dying
It’s a cold, cold world, I think these niggas need the iron
Like, ""Blaow""

I woke up this morning feeling just like I'm a star
No I don't drink but I might buy the bar
Like shots on me because I ain't get shot
That's on my soul, Diana Ross
I am on my pivot like I am Ross
I am a force to be reckoned
Like a western film, might pull up on a horse
This is the part where the party is over
But you and your friends know you will not go home
This for my niggas who went and got fired
Just 'cause they desire to grow their hair long
I just said peace to the past like ""so long""
I don't smoke weed yet they passing the bong
Chiefin' the reefer just like Cheech and Chong
This for the teachers who told me that songs won't go a long way
But I'm a long way from home because of it, ayy
Look at this love that I'm covered in, ayy
Built from the ground up, a architect
I present just like a scientist
I'm in this, I give just 'cause I am blood, yeah
Opposite of what they government
I protect people that show me their love, yeah

So just stay right here
Love me from the mountain to the grave right here
Ain't no way it's ever gonna change right here, yeah

Look at all the love around me
Look at all the love around me

I said I pivot like my name was Ross
Pivot, Diana Taurasi
Pivot like Moss, he all squeak
I'm with a army, audience applause
Ain't been the same since Walt's autopsy
I just wish that I could call him, tell him 'bout tour
Tell him how shit not the same like before
Tell him how labels knockin' at the door
Tell him about how my face in The Source or somethin'
Call upon the Lord to come my Autumn
Though I'll never get to see the day
That my daughter come, ignore the dumb
Shit that come with the territory, share the story, all of 'em
Even with the little twist like Oliver all of the time
I told the block y'all should open your eyes
I come from nothing but drugs and the crime
I sung out, oh yes I made it alive
Shouts to the fans and they gave me some time, yeah
Look at the love that I'm covered in
Kept it a hundred, I coveted
This is all real, ain't no supplement
Own all my masters and publishing
Head to Korea, they fuck with it

Look at all the love around me

Look at all of the love around me, astounding
How niggas still found the time to hate my county
Been cookin' niggas that look like me
We all got bounties on our heads and business is bountiful
My niggas accounted for
Two accountants to run my checks and balances
I never bank on balance though
We stay good with the handy work
But if I can't see a callous that can't be worth a dime
They say that a dollar'll make you rich
But that fake shit can't be worth the time
I got a eight to my face when I have the time
Smoking these days just to pass the time
Smoking sometimes just to stare in your face
Or just to stare in the mirror, I'm scared of standing in place
Even the slowest of paces
Keeping you on the move, it behooves you
All this mindless behavior we're used to
I kick it like Bruce Lee, I be like the water I'm deep in this shit
I'm a young Fela Kuti whippin' a hooptie, we smoked out
Boys at the corner store loc'd out
We stop at the corner store anyway
Look at all of the love around me

You better be strapped cause them niggas over there just ain't good

From being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous

If you wanna battle, it's either that you will or you won't
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
If you got some fire shit, yo niggas gonna always toke
Dope, is not what I be slanging on this track
Niggas don't comprehend that it be deeper than Cadillacs
You know that, right, you bite, you fucked up
You won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up

But a method, of having black and brown bodies fill them

Investing in injustice, fear and long suffering

My feelings just can’t discard
The way in which I fell into
Your heart was never what I once knew
Lately my skull has kept
Dividing lines deep set and paved
Two paths too wander through to depart
And sever desires to pursue

And the soul chokes
To cause the tide
To enforce divide
This whole ocean has morphed in time
I’ll escort her mind to solve my crimes
Reach slow motion to con the mind

See here I trace my steps
To where my senses left
And rain had turn my sense to mush

Everything just look so crazy up here baby
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

When every record that you put out, got them throwin' they tush out
Pray they play it at cookouts, got the whole city shook now
People talkin' like, ""Look now, I told you that they gon' make it""
Them same niggas that hated got you all up in they playlist
'Cause the world concentratin', the crucial contemplation
You two-steppin' with these heffers, I'm receiving revelations
You twirlin' in girls, I'm swimming in women who curl up like curls
Body remind me of some thoroughs that I used to ride back in Seaside
She know I'm tryna quit, but see she my bad habit
Nice to meet you I had it
We got features, y'all got snips
Bought casinos, y'all bought chips
Y'all ain't seen nothin' like this
I dip my paintbrush in a bucket like fuck it and get some mo'
See all I know is the foreman, yeah he from Campbellton Road
I know y'all ain't been told
I made it, waited, weighed it flew this shit in from the '80s
Distribution conducted by all of my lovely ladies
I promise I ain't budgin'
I promise I ain't make it 'til I'm rakin' in a 100k a month and that ain't nothin'
Half of that stashed into something I ain't touchin'
After that smashed into somethin' I ain't lovin'
After my first meal, ""What you buyin?"", I say, ""Nothin'""
Relocate into the jungle, paradise in the bungalow
I finally got some diamonds in my wrist
My nigga Yoda finally got some ice off in this bitch
Finally, I might even get off this hype of ghetto trip
Syringe steel stickin' out my Benz, still picking out my friends
Speed datin' with my ends, it's a cinch
You'd think they huntin' DAs they way we hopped up off the fuckin' bench
I heard one is from the S.W.A.T.S., you know the other one is too
It's crazy how all the shit we say start to come true
Countryside with my boo, hoppin' out that ooh
Searchin' for our papers, man I pray they let us through
We got babies waitin' mouths to feed, that teacher too
You can call it what you want, I just call the shit the truth
Never steppin' in the booth unless it's for the right quota

What if I looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms
Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it, whoo
To put that bitch in slower motion, got the potion and the antidote

And then one day, it turns to clay
It blows away, it finds a ray, it finds its way

I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life no longer infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
In disbeliefs our belief's the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking, and crumbling
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover, the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling ""he's alive""
Backpedaling Christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tides out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it

(It's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
""What have you did for me""
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th, 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes, pray to God that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise, I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly for you
Told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you
Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you
I tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I'mma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church

Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau
Some belong to strangers, and some to folks you know
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
To beautify the foothills, and shake the many hands

Nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
See a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words?

When you've finished with the mop, then you can stop
And look at what you've done
The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen
And the work, it was fun

Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood
But those were all just guesses

I swear all my life I been around crips and bloods
Grips and slugs, the trigger happiest thugs
Claiming the slums, and all the hoods that they from
Too much of the some, got it twisted up blinded in a rat race
Cash straight, the fake kill jake, the snakes too late
My eyes dilate, and I could tell them how he strafe
Coming at me sideways, get straighten up
Don't deflate it up gimmie the bucks my cash wrinkling up
Looking back in the days
Amazed 'cause the lab rat done made it out the maze
Still feel caged, enraged though
Used the underground railroad like a runaway slave
Broke off the chains still runway fresh
Got you on that mental plane with my project jet
I'm two steps above that nimbus cloud
My limit is low, when I'm smoking on that loud
Focus in the now, when the lotus is around
It's the Brooklyn sound, a pro found, Biggie would be proud about
But I don't need a vet to even shout me out
Punchlines pack a Pacquiao they can't box me out

A thousand ghetto youths with a thousand guns

Did you see me feeding all my drinks to Cam?

From where I sat she looked to be having fun
Keeping up with you, just like I used to
Hey there bud, how'd it go last night?
I'm sorry to have ditched out but I was pretty high
Heard from Leslie that on his stumble home
Nat was puking up all that beer she'd drunk
Though we didn't talk much how'd your evening go
You barely spoke a word to me besides that slurred hello
But I happened to see without even tryin'
How she laughed with you, just like I used to
Hey there bud, how'd it go last night?
I woke up to a pair of shoes I've not seen next to mine
Did you whisper as you crept in through the door
How you'd never done much like this before?

Someone took too long in the shower
Soup pot on the stove full of bath water
The water won't be back hot for another hour
The bus come in 20 minutes, guess you gotta problem
What you know bout being grounded from the juke spot
Cause you got caught stealing meat up out the soup pot
Motivation changed at 13 years old. In high school
With kids who vacations could pay off my loans
Imagine your friend being in a million dollar home
And you come back to yours being heated by the stove
My mom oshun in the flesh. Atlantic Ocean in flesh
I’m a king in my death. Royalty in every breath
Loyalty with every step. And I mean you know dilla
So it ain't too many niggas like me left
Hood niggas rock with me it’s likeI moved packs with them
School niggas rock with me it’s like I skipped classes with them
Niggas praying backwards missing blessings that done came
How you gone ask for flowers but complain about the rain
I’m like where your seeds at? Nigga, you ain't know you need that?
Niggas mentally in high school man it's a strange thing
Imagine living until 84 and only peaking at 18
Imagine putting real feelings only into fake things
I had to sit down with E and let him know when we was home
Yeah you up now but remember though you was broke
It can happen at any time so stay on yo toes
Keep some up in the cut to give future you a loan
Cause they show you love now but just remember that they don't
They used to over look me. But I'll be ROY
The best rookie. Can't B Roy I just reinforced the knees
I'm more Dame with my mine and I think that lotto would agree
Cause I’m free lunch. Perkins loan, pell grant getting
Getting rich with my niggas. Don't trust niggas if he won't cry with you or die with you
And if he don't trust judgement even if y’all disagree
Then that means he can't ride with you
I watch from back as you front on yourself
At least your Jackie Chan you doing stunts yourself
Now I’m Living above average but move like a gotta manage
Cause I'm gone take they standards and cause a lotta damage
They teach you how to floss but nothing about finances
17  worried being cool , well was spending bread on random shoes and fits
I could’ve invested that, and damn near upped my credentials
So when I tell you about saving, I'm tryna save your potential
You leech a nigga then you won't probably understand us
Well that's fine it wasn't meant for you. Thank you listening
And letting me vent to you. We built this from the ground up
You know from cement with you. I know it's all good with you
West end born. In the wood where slept at night. Man it helped me grow
Running through the city , but that’s where I did my dirt. That’s where I learned that lil niggas used to walk around with poles
Wasn't till I lost myself that I found soul. Found myself and found my goals
Found love. Found peace. Got degrees. And I found them loans
But we gone pay them hoes off with flows
That's on my soul.  Welcome home dilla
Welcome home
Cause how you get lost tryna find yourself?
Not knowing you been here all along and to remind yourself
Welcome home Dilla
Welcome home
Welcome home Dilla
Welcome home
If you're reading this, which I hope you won’t have to
You might be lost again. No worries. I left this for you
I’ve watched you struggle with this idea of freedom
And what it feels like. But I know where it starts
By learning. you. Your story
Which is nothing but a collection of moments anyway
So I kept some for you. Stored away in the same spot
I left it, you just have to dig a little
Just like we all do to find who we are. With that being said
I hope this brings you back. Or never need it

And cinder block cemeteries already ascended
I'll leave you my last name I left on the last plane
Too much baggage but you can carry on Bennett

When we wash all our pain away
We say, ""Oh, my Lord""
When we can't make it through the day
We pray, oh, my Lord
It's a test coming to my faith
We pray, oh, my Lord, mmh
Will my people ever be safe?
In the land that takes us and breaks us, I can't be sure

Walking with the Lord, I see footprints
My mama always told me use my good sense
Common always looking for the good sense
Since we all got good in our essence
In the hood sense, we all good anyway
That's why you always hear another dollar, 'nother day
I see the day as a new beginning
Movement of the people, movement of the women
To get the Earth spinning in the right direct
This movie of life, sometimes might project
Acts, scenes that don't seem serene
I light palo santo, put on Love Supreme
And get into the being of the great I am
That's when I get to seeing just how great I am
Many many times from mistakes, I ran
But I'm just a cake, let me bake, goddamn
I pray I don't forsake my man
And whenever I fall, on faith, I land
Imperfections, resurrections
In the mirror staring at God's reflection
Reflecting on my aggressions
On my progressions, on my obsessions
There's a lesson in not feeling less
And in seeing life itself as a blessing

When we wash all our pain away
We say, ""Oh, my Lord""
When we can't make it through the day

Giving my enemies something new to see
My community, they be fueling me
In the struggle of us, there's a unity
The moral universe stay schooling me
Will the king of kings really rule in me?
I'm an instrument, stay in tune with me
This orchestrated by Karriem, Samora, Boom, and me
If agape had a Cupid, she'd be shooting me
This rap here is fear's eulogy
Escape rooms with glasses of wine
Just another crutch for my brokenness
A term that I got from my therapist
As a black man, I feel I should be sharin' this
In the hood they say we crazy and we derelicts
But we needed for our kids and our marriages
The old folks say we don't do that
But taking care of self is the new black
Unconventional ways, unconditional ways
Mediation, mindfulness, it's just given to praise
I'm in a phase, all I see is victory
You on that wave, then come and get with me
I only want what's meant for me
And say the things that's sent to me
In penitentiaries, I met the most enlightened
Finding the losses, Heaven's excitement
I write with a force of a kid that wanted to
Be in The Source, but that changed, of course
I maintained the sauce and became a boss
I apologize if I came across
As judgmental, or self-righteous
'Cause in you, I see his likeness

Bitches, what's up with ya?
I hate calling the women ""bitches,"" but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to

Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember?

I don't drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit

To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with, fuck is up?
Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it

But, boo, don't be alarmed
I'm just trying to make your palms reach the ceiling
Now, I've been traveling back and forth across this world for too long
And your body got me feeling I ain't been here

Paying bitches in quotes, paying niggas with jokes
Baby girl, that's just the half—it's okay if you choke
Your mama love me anyway; sent me a plate with her vote
She told you, ""Baby, that's the devil; better grab him, don't let him go
See, he a bad man, but the angel ain't never go
And he gon' treat you right—but these hoes, he gon' let 'em know""
Now go ahead; hit the floor
And show me why they know your whole name round the world
Silhouette, pretty girl
Probably thinking, ""Why he sitting over there, barely speaking?
Staring through my soul at my ass, barely peaking?""
A year ago, you and your girls were barely leaking
Now, it's spilling in my lap
Pussy well, very beat
So I understand when you see the man
It's like Peter Pan
Niggas get some courage, try to skip across the median
Please, stick to your side
Bragging about your shoes and your little YouTube views

My intestines are a buzz—a buzz!
It seems my hunger making way to much just not enough, 'nough
Fuck the D.A. and the Judge
The Grand Wizard spill it in your spirit and your blood
Hard to find reality on planet three
So for these answers, we sending out satellites
And for these dancers, we handing out stacks of green
With a mind full of nasty things like an ashy teen
But with a enough elbow grease to put a whale through a shoelace
We working for a new day, to scenes from a movie
Dexter told me, ""Bruh, your time is coming just be cool, wait""
Spark the joint like juicy—mazel tov, like jews say
I'm from a long line of lost causes
Who found the light like the fridge at night
Only to realize, there ain't a smidge to bite
So we turn to cannibals—hide your kids and wife

Just a couple pre-requisites to deal with the shit I'm carrying
Down from the mountain top
Really not the marrying-type
But I love you for the rest of my life, though
Jump into that icy water, swim to that life boat
Oops, my bad, baby, you real bad, baby
I would of chose, but my minds been on the globe lately
So my faith's a little shaky, couldn't blame you if you hate me

Faster than the speed of an eagle with a diesel tank
Swoop down on unsuspecting prey
Now you amazon texting like each and every day
T'ill I see you face to face you've got nothing else to say
Oooh—girl, you make me shiver, oooh—I'm 'bout to get ya
So intoxicating, lord protect my liver, uhh

Packed up and ready to go
Heard of some gravesites, out by the highway
A place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire, off in the distance
I'm getting used to it now
Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto
I've lived all over this town

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco
This ain't no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey
I ain't got time for that now

Transmit the message, to the receiver
Hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, a couple of visas
You don't even know my real name
High on a hillside, the trucks are loading
Everything's ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nighttime
I might not ever get home

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco
This ain't no fooling around
This ain't no Mudd Club, or C.B.G.B
I ain't got time for that now

Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit?
Heard about Pittsburgh, P. A.?
You oughta know not to stand by the window
Somebody'll see you up there
I got some groceries, some peanut butter
To last a couple of days
But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones
Ain't got no records to play

Why stay in college? Why go to night school?
Gonna be different this time
Can't write a letter, can't send no postcard
I ain't got no time for that now

Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock
We blended in with the crowd
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines
I know that that ain't allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle so many times now
I don't know what I look like
You make me shiver, I feel so tender
We make a pretty good team
Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving
You ought to get you some sleep
Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks?
They won't help me survive
My chest is aching, burns like a furnace
The burning keeps me alive

Ever since a nigga had recess
Mothafucka felt like a grownup (Soulo)
Momma come and bitch about a curfew
I was still playing 'round the corner
7 years old saw my first porno, damn, that fucked me up
At 10, I bust my first nut on this older ho gut, but so what
Let's recap, the earth spinning too rapid
I'm living too fast, sinning's a habit
I can't hack, fornicate, act this rabid
One bean short of an acid tablet
Security guards spark my cigarettes
The old head go 'head and cop me a brew
Sometimes them Koreans be cool
These shades make me look 22
They say you learn when you get older
I just say that that ain't true
That just means when you was younger
You ain't get turnt up like us, fool
Just got Ls so I'm riding high, still in high school but I do
Everything I will do, when I'm 25, no lie

I was young with ambition, fucked around with these hoes (Hoes)
Never needed permission, went and lived the life that I chose (Chose)
Premonition-type visions, you see the world as it goes (Goes)
Tell 'em all what they missing, while I watch it as it unfolds
I'm dodging my death, confident kid
I was tryna grow up with the best (Oh, oh)
Watching my step, never no college plan
Found myself nodding off always on test-day
I coulda been a great graduate
Woulda got one of them hoes from ""The Bachelor""
Could've been smart, could've been a doctor
Life full of drama, little soap opera
Falling in love, lucky that I caught ya
Almost got her knocked up, would've been a father
All about energy, make good memories
I'm the fucking Dalai Lama (Ooh!)
Only 18 but I had my own business
Then I got fame like ""what the fuck is this?""
Whole bunch of cameras, fake ass bitches (Yeah, yeah)
Everyone around wanna treat me all different
Oh I'm cool, cause I got money? (All this money)
Back in high school none of these hoes was tryna fuck me (Fuck me)
I thought it was a conspiracy
Sometimes my thoughts start scaring me
You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets

They, they, they been looking for somebody like me
Big bag of weed and a muddy iced tea
Something brand new, wonder what it might be
Coughing off them drugs, moving at a nice speed
If you 18 years and older
18 years and older
If you 18 years and older
18 years and older

I wanna rule the world, take care of my family
And take care of my girl, plant a couple seeds

Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

Truck jewels, big stacks, mustard boots
Construction on her feet, she eat duck confit
I shoot up the club whenever I hit it raw
If she have a baby by me, I'ma love her more
Brings food to the crib when I'm laying low
And she know how to roll weed, but don't smoke
Chinese massages, wifey, no side-chick
Go sight-seeing with the god
Playing cards with my dad, frying chicken for the mob
Simply Lemonade, raspberry for the wash, gosh
She know who tryin' to rock her to sleep to get to me
Give 'em the side eye when she see 'em in the street
Her brother locked up, he doin' ten up in the beast
He's short, he comin' home and she hyped for his release
Fly her to Hollywood, watch flicks from Nollywood
Like hydraulics, she ride the wood

Said, ""It's straight,"" we need a place up in Jamaica Estates
And she was like, ""Oh no"" in a silky Kimono
Said the streets, the snakes, plus Governor Cuomo
Flashes out the window, people takin' my photo
She knew I wasn't gon' be no husband, I be a no-show
Leave her standin' at the altar, bro, I couldn't falter

Lookin' like Janet, dance like Michael

Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking

Probably is, but odds are we’ll never cross paths

Crack the Patrón, Hennessy and Glenlivets
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows
Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow

Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling

Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her
Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer
Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers
And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose
Liars brag they put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Better stay on point, if not it's curtains
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me probably
If music money didn't stop me
I never claimed to be the toughest
Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed
It's the game that we was stuck with
Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids
Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went
No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket
It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit
Bo cooking blow, fuck is Slate at? Where Turkey went?
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since
Another reason to get further bent

Now is the time to get on, like Spike Lee said, ""Get on the Bus""
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirpin', it's a must
Is you on that dust or cornstarch? Familiar with that smack, man?
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman, how in the fuck you think we gon' do that, man?
Ridin' round Old National on 18's without no gat, man
I'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times, swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga, don't get no wood grain steering wheel

Lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
And beauty parlors and baby ballers
And bowling ball Impalas and street scholars
Majoring in culinary arts, you know, how to work bread
Cheese, and dough from scratch, but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya selling, what you bought so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge, meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin' bad, need some hope like the words 'maybe'
'if', or 'probably', more than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall
I'm sorry y'all, I often drift, I'm talking gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but it's needed, so what have you?
Now question: is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw
So don't get caught up in appearance
It's OutKast, Aquemini, another black experience

Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar, that was an awesome day
Did counselling, couldn't force me to stay
Something happens when you say I do, we go astray
Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all
Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault
He in the grave – let it go, he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women
Fuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck
Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up
No matter who you fuck, that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since before I saw you screaming
""Hate you so much right now""
Should've saw the meaning, angry black woman
Actions of a demon, I'm leaving

I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird
Same time, different year, I was digging y'all flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin
Yet the cuter version, yet I knew you personally
Better than you knew yourself – and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican, you got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life, like ""Ha, yo, look at my wife!""
Gangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night
Bailed you out, next morning we got clean
Like it never happened, and later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life of two people in love
But it wasn't enough, so baby, guess what...

I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
OH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition
Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?
With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half
Not some, but half, no, serious, half
Half of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind
It’s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was selfish cowards
Under their breath, saying, ""Why did Nas trust her?""
But look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh!
You live with your baby moms
And scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even alive
At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride
He got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type
And watch me do it all again – it’s a beautiful life, aight?
Goodbye!

I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk
Do how them hustlers do
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
Always claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And make my money 'cause my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
Ain't nothing wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that
But you ain't know I'm the one dipping and dodging bullets

They were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head, greasy face, eating watermelon

Our heavenly Father, why do you even bother watching over me?
Growing up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten
This ain't no secret garden, so you flower niggas flee
If it is one of my own, I'm letting the trigger be
'Cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me
And then I get a slap or dap from niggas slinging quarter keys
Just trying to make it, then of age, come through, take it
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be working Nikki's butt naked
At Magic City, shaking titties just to pay the rent
Lord, trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent
But I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinking
I think about Barack, strap myself and keep on danking
'Cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain
If you cross my path, I'll leave you draining like a fountain
Yes it's been like that since way back, in 1975
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive
So little batty bwoy better say your prayers
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya

And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""

Can’t get enough, can’t get enough
Eastside, Westside, worldwide, ride out

Now, I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet
But that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rockin' with the best, mane
Dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed, mane
Let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she’s fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl
‘Cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming off of my last name
‘Cause I really can’t take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit
Your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy.”
But I’m signed to the Roc
No time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids!

She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows

Hoes holla, ’cause they love my sound
And I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that’ll cut all night
That’ll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight
Tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight
On the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head
I hate it when you give me headaches

She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes

It brought me to tears
I came home and bought me a crib
I walk through that bitch
Strapped when it's dark in that bitch
And through hell and high water, I just walk on a bridge

I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said ""You know what, girl? You crazy."" Then she asked me what he said...

(What did the Asian say?) ""A peace of mind""
That's what the Asian said—I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked him what are you doing, he said ""taking my time""
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?

(What did the Indian say?) ""A piece of land""
That's what the Indian said—I needed the man
Telling me longevity is in the dirt
Should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed

(Now, what the black man say?) ""A piece of pussy""
That's what the black man said I needed to push me
To the limit, to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war
We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said ""nigga, come back to reality for a week""
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it

(What the white man say?) A piece of mine's
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
""Look at what you accomplishing""; what he said to the boy
""I'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist if I don't target your market
If you ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
Your world tour, your master's, mortgage, I need a piece""

462,469,eminem_offended,"You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment
Shoot the bailiff, karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby isn’t robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawin' them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description, ain't nobody dippin'
Out the back of the club like, ""Oh my God, he's trippin'!""
Only time you get the blade is
Probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing
I'm still coppin' a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, poppin' a pill
Then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby
A lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blond fuck's reprehensible
Misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles
Is gone, but 'til I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And Senator Mitch McConnell’s
Just as big of a bitch as Donald—
Shit's on, bruh! (Ha-ha)
Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff-arm her while I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam
On nanny cam, I'm gettin' handies with the zanny Xannys
In the Caddy armrest, I'm imaginin' objects
So I'm battin' cobwebs from a daddy longleg
In Hamtramck
Got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice her age and I'm actin' half it (Ha-ha)
Grow up?
Nah, not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul
Got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Klonopins
Like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol
And go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to
An interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal
You're so appalled (Em…)
So's my manager
Bitch, I amateur, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me—
'Cause I don't own a mirror!
But, Marshall, you are terrific
So smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits, whiff it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives're butcher than gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push into caput'cha
When I pull 'em like (What?) sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
To make it on Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine
Waitin' in a buffet line
So, Kellyanne Conway
I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been makin' wedding plans all day

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

Eight-year-old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape
'Cause you're in a slurrin' state
I’m a 10, you’re an eight (Urinate)
Like what I do before, after, and durin' rape!
You wanna get into a pissin' contest
And find out who's better?
And be made a fool out of when I pull on 'em?
R. Kelly with a full bladder (R. Kelly with a full bladder)
Non-high school grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge
My degrees is the same as I got in college (Zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like Haloti, partner
Blow me, told you I'm so dirty, homie, you can throw me
In some holy water, with some floaties on
And get the soap and try to get the Pope to hold me
While you hose me off and, nope, I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode
I gotta blow this spot up though, I got a lotta mo'
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained
Dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone (Uh-huh)
I get why you're tapped
""But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back!""
Is what I tell myself
When times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
But I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie
When life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad:
Don't cry, get mad!
'Cause little baby powders
Belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass (Sodomy!)
Foot up it, I stood up for the kid
Who had to put up with the bullies at his school (At his school)
You ain't had to have no money
Or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude (Attitude)
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain
That's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish
I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it, then I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage (Minimum wage)
But it's embedded in my head I never hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
I put up in the pen, and when I'm dead I wonder
Will they put me on a pedestal or forget I was ever this incredible?
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause
I'll never get another motherfuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this, I can simply because I can

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up

Unappreciated, unalleviated
Tired of comin' up short—fuck abbreviated

No pain, no gain, I blow brains—Cobain
Throw flames, Liu Kang, the coach ain't help out, so I call my own shots
I'm David Blaine, I'm breakin' out of my own box, you stay the same
But homie if you change, may you change for the better
Back when Martin King had a thing for Coretta
Wonder if she seen all the dreams he was dreamin'
Did she have a clue of all the schemes he was schemin'
Still loved him just enough to put up with the cheatin'
Months go by and only see him for a weekend
I say a prayer—hope my girl ain't leavin'
We all got angels, we all got demons
As you fall through the club
Bad bitches down to do all the above
Money comes fast so bein' hungry don't last
Till you look in the mirror and you saw who you was
Cole World—it couldn't be more clearer
The time is now—couldn't be more here-er
My reign gonna last like 3-4 eras
Say hello to the real, I can be your hero

Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me

You thinking I'ma fall, don't be so sure

On how to get up off the sidelines

Up in 1st class, laugh even though it's not funny
See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money
While he sit at coach, hate to see me walk past 'im
Young black pants sag, headphones blastin'
Know what he askin', ""how did he manage?""
""With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage!""
Slang we be speakin' probably soundin' like Spanish
Then I fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners
Some New York niggas thought it was funny callin' us 'Bama
Laughin' at the grammar cause they didn't understand us
Must've thought we slow, but little do they know
I came up in here to take advantage of that shit y'all take for granted
Opportunity that I would kill for
Lookin' at rappers like ""what the fuck you got a deal for?!""
When I was assed out with my funds low
It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door

On how to get up off the sidelines

I made it to the rock, even though they tried to box me out
I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out
But what they don’t understand is this is all plan
It’s a bigger picture and you can’t photoshop me out
Some nigga ask me why Jay never shout me out
Like I’m supposed to give a fuck
Don’t you know that I be out in France
Where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao
Not cause my looks, cause my hooks could knock Rocky out
And my lines is designed from the heart
Young Simba been a lion from the start
Dumb nigga’s, y’all been lyin from the start
My life’s like a movie, truly
And these niggas is dyin' for the part
But, you’ll never play me like LeBron vs. Jordan
Twenty years, wonder who they gone say was more important
Both changed the game, came through and made a lane
Who’s to say that who’s greater, all we know, they ain’t the same

Hey, I'ma put us all on the map

You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go—hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!

My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (Yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buildin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison

(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet

I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies' tails
Should write a children's storybook (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City, uh
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me

I ride around town like this is my town
Rapping to myself, trying to see how I sound
Kinda arrogant cause I’m from Chi Town
East bound & down, that’s how we get down
At the bar taking shots like they live rounds
My lifestyle is it’s good to be alive now
Lot that surround me, places all cloudy
Came in the Audi, pied piper rowdy
You in the 'Raq where it's war like Saudi
Youngins carry the iron man, like Robert Downey
Pound the ground we own the concrete jungle
Surround me loudly, wildly is how we came up
Think about the come up
That’s why I’m always on edge when the fans seem to run up
Hair all done up, we can spend the summer together
But when the weather change, lady friend
You may be forever stranger lines seem to blur
Yea I like you but I still love her, uh uh uh
I come from the under, wonder why they slumbered on a nigga
Now I see the bigger picture, pour a little liquor
The rich get richer, my dick get bigger
Cause I’mma go hard, g-go g-go hard
The more I know self, the more I know God
Coppin’ land from my bro Monar
Good to do business with the bro-gods, let the dollar circulate
Lower the murder rate but still kill this shit
In touch with the crib that’s why you feel this shit
The willingness to grow, the willingness to blow
The willingness to know that I don’t know shit

But I still wanna know
What the fuck you on girl

I used the syllables, y'all, to forever dream
Now I’m a Champagne King like Evelyn

211,216,common_7 deadly sins,"Gluttony, baby
To me, it's what I see
Gluttony, baby
Is us, it's hard to see
It's knocking
Gluttony, baby
To me, it's what I see
Man, they gon', they gon'
Man they gon' knock this
And ride out to this

It sit deep in my chest, so let me express
Grew up on 868, oh, y’all don’t need the address
It was ‘round CVS, we were so devious
The city never sleeps, it be needing some rest
The streets was a mess, and they still are
Feel our pain, the bigger picture, we was all framed
But the game is the game, so let it begin
In these streets, these are the seven deadly sins
Now, the first is pride, though some call it vanity
A hustler's insanity can break up the family
Pride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change
Knowing that he'll end up in a grave
It's the arrogance, they say, in us Americans
Messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting
Like the second is something we all have
Or felt, than Cain or Khan, it's called wrath
I seen a boss take it out on his staff
Seen a crip take it out on a blood, causing a bath
Never seen a man making money while he mad
So hustle plus wrath? Y'all do the math
Now the third, you probably heard from MOP
They say use them rocks to make 'em envy
Envy, the cousin of jealousy, on the streets it's a felony
When niggas fucking with you but commit infidelity
They hate it, to see you celebrated
Counting my paper, nigga, you could have made it
Let me stay with that thought, takes us to the fourth
Where niggas is lazy, that's what we call sloth
Want you to break em off, getting money it costs
For you to be a boss, ain't no taking off
Now the myth about the fifth: it only happens when we eat
It’s gluttony, this is how it happens on the street
It’s a dude that’s getting paid in full, cars and jewels
So his plate is full, but the way this nigga move
He is never full and he gon' want your food
Don't overdo it, that's an underrated rule
The sixth is a fix that's in all of us
When I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust
When the drawers go down, the guards go down
Cause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now
Okay, the seventh is a seed that many believe
Is the cause of 'em all, this is what we call greed
Knew some cousins that was hustlin', one of em ended up bustin' the other
Greed is a mother, it’s greedy motherfuckers like Madoff
Cops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off
Before I sign off, in the sins we livin'
The good thing is we can be forgiven

Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like ""That's not your jersey?""
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still think I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face

1600,1629,eminem_walk on water,"I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (Fuck)

Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter–
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

'Cause I'm just a man

To ever come together around a common purpose. They said

The world, the world, the WORLD...

They forgot us on the block, got us in the box
Solitary confinement: how violent are these cops?
They need a early retirement
How many rallies will I watch? I ain't got it in me to march
I got a Semi to spark, the game's in a drought
Public housing, projects, cooking up in the Pyrex
My set, my clique, either getting money
Or running from homicide trial, that's if they ain't died yet
Trying to be rich, still I'm pledging allegiance
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader
Lending my poetical genius, to whoever may need it
I bleed this from Queensbridge, now living with my feet up
Never defeated, so a president's needed
You know these colored folks and Negros hate to see
One of their own succeeding
America: surprise us and let a black man guide us, uhh

Loading up mine too, ready to ride
'Cause I'm riding with my crew - he dies, we die too
Yeah, but on the positive side
I think Obama provides hope and challenges minds
Of all races and colors to erase the hate
And try to love one another, so many political snakes
We in need of a break, I'm thinking I can trust this brother

Deacon for defense, progress-producer

Gotta do what we gotta do
We ain't got no governors coming through to help
Anything we need done, gotta do for self
New, improved JFK on the way
It ain't the 60s again, niggas ain't hippies again
We ain't falling for the same traps
Standing on the balconies where they shot the King at
McCain got apologies; ain't nobody hearing that
People need honesty

Abusing my power full of resentment

So I went running for answers

Where did we go wrong?
Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne

Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah
Say

Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I can only feel his pain
'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a sling
Call me ""Heartbreak Drake"", I'm the hardest one to tame

I'm nuttin' in her mouth, you tongue kissin' her after
Daughters' moms kinda want me neutered
But they also want the kid to cum right on they cooter
Have the music soundin' better than guitar tuners
Plus I'm doin' shows daily, call me Jon Stewart

And craft in a certain way, followed by a 6 month loan delay

Aston Martin king, Luther with dreams
The young Denzel the way I move through scenes
I’m like a preacher that once was a fiend
A story of change that came with wings
Pretty as the skyline, the sky is my eyeline
Son of the most so from up high I shine
Suited in Prada, stay mellow like lala
Young, fresh, with dollars, ladies go gaga
I’m the cum-lada, top of the class
Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash
Given what I ask, pure religion and cash
From the windows that open, I’m raising my glass
Daylight beams, night life schemes
This is my inception, I’m writing my dreams
Immortal view of a star doing what I’m born to do
I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through

Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right

It all started with a dream, I wanted to be Run–D.M.C
The Lord put the blessing upon the MC
O to the M, dreams were spoken to him
That's when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim
Open my eyes, yes sir this is what I'm made for
To go hard in the paint like D. Wade or
D. Rose, from the same streets that we rose
International heroes at world primos
Red carpet magic, taking pictures with the president
Told him for health care, my music is the medicine
My name holds weight, I am never hesitant
Different state resident, this is hood elegance
SLS classic, pursuing my passion
NOVA Fashion, now I'm Oscar party crashing
Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through

Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right

Silhouettes of dreams that we had high, huh
Even now it don't seem so bad, ma
Close my eyes to see things in front of me
I'm gone now, imagine what I'm gonna be
Dirty to worthy, now I'm all wordy
My broad up in Paris, looking all purty
Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky, see the Lord's coming through

Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, ain't too high, we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, that's right

I had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere
I could see it from my window
Wouldn't take that long to get me there
Keep running til' I can go
Remember the beautiful things that life could give me
Crazy how I'm the one
Could've been anywhere, but I'm sitting in the air
With the wheels up staring at the sun
Ohh, in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh, until high we'll shine at night

This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you’re home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

3:45AM can't sleep, can't dream
I'm stuck, money problems pop up
How will I survive?
Guess it's best to decide not to decide
So that's my decision
Whatever happens happens
I keep making my millions
Can see myself in Presidential campaign dinners
But I'm passing blunts around a bunch of gang members
When you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles
And you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
And outgrow women you loved and thought you could stay with
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
And leave notes around for yourself to remember
I like to teach and build
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mil
All you need is some skill, then it’s grind time
Imagination better than knowledge, says Einstein
It’s all in the mind
Nasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic
Just one minute after it's heard
You all'll recite it, you all'll repeat it
You'll call me a genius, if you didn't
Now that I said it I forced you to think it
Write in my little vignettes, sipping Moët
Bitch when you vision me, you vision the best
When I was young they called me Olu's son
Now he's Nas' father, I was the good seed
He was the wise gardener

This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aww baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you’re home

Yeah, what y'all know about this..
Yo, beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas
Conservatives don’t understand slang linguistics
The burbs talking like the hood will change with quickness
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness
So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious
Get out a gangsta's business, seems to me your thoughts are basic
Try to compare what you live to the life I master
See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after
Big bracelets, golden Egyptian faces
White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation
The strip club scene favors Josephine Baker
Dope fiend neighbors, growing up I seen paper
I describe it, hope you can visualize it
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project
When my British Knights can rival your Foamposites
Don’t make me pull my Lottos out the closet
Ha ha ha

This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove

Watching all this sucker shit, look at the pretenders
Thinking how the rap game was
I dig, I dug, I push, I shove, yeah I fell out of love
But it ain't no thing, telephone ring
They don't make 'em like they make 'em when I used to bang
So I try to show the little homies different things
How to diversify, and change different lanes
Learn to read a little, exercise your brain
Mental gymnastics, it's a cold game
Always knew that they would try and trip me, trick me but they couldn't
Cause all my teachers and doctors were curious to the furnace
The honorable speaks
Like Minister Louis Farrakhan my influence is deep
Cause it's truth

Ask her how to deal with that, she looked at me said she don’t
She be off the smoke and coke, she say that what’s she like I think that just how she cope
Tell my niggas that I love 'em man I’m trying to do that more
Let 'em know 'fore for they go, cause when they walk out that door

At least if I tell 'em that I love em, have no nightmares
You know I be up all night, well at least that’s just how I sleep

Watch the company you keep
Said the ones you need, the ones who think how think without you having to even speak
Even learning how to speak, on how things effecting me

I’m learning to listen more, expose all my feelings more
Still manage my energy, love to love, not  to fill void

He told me focus on books, so many homies up on papers
I can staple 'em damn near make some books

Big, slide into the mode, time to drop a load
My life is going downhill like some cardboard in the snow
My bank account is frozen, I
Don't think that I can get out this hold
Feel like the figure four leglock
Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked
I can't move, I can't eat, I can't even breathe
Can't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds
No trees, no P's to ease the stress of everyday living
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they living
The unforgiven or the unwilling, live a life of sinning
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginning
But—what about repentance?
What about detention?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
What about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah..

Why are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Please tell me - what are we here for?
OW!

Life, is nothing but a dream, so peaceful and serene
Unless you're being evil then you on the devil's team
Wide receive what you want to believe
But soon you'll have to sew those bad seeds
Please, any man can ask to get a pass
Or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle
'Cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible
As you survey the syllables and sentences
The question that I'm merely trying to pose is as simple as me saying
What about repentance?
What about detention?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
What about repentance?
What about committing the same sin

Burnin' them bitches like a ci-gar
Punk, put a hump in your back, they called it Igor!
War? This shit is hard, any yard where we are

You can come at me for beef and shots come with that
Your bitch come at me for wood and I'm the lumberjack
I come in that Similac Maybach, shades black
Looking like I'm tryna bring yay back, ASAP
Give it to 'em raw, no Ajax, taste that

Off a FEMA check? (Nope!)
Coke in the Pyrex (Yup!); dope and the ice, yes (Yup!)
Mind on the highway, road signs, right, left (Yup!)
And that's the mindstate of kids growin' up

Throw it up: Eastside, Westside, Southside, Northside
Fuck with my money, I torch guys, off guys (Gangsta!)
Hire men, fire men, send 'em to a higher man
(""There he go"") Torture 'em: vice-grip, pliers, man

Move like a lion through the jungle, yes
There is none higher than me
Don't slip up and end wind up in the lion's den (rrr!)

A chick that flight-attend or Air Force flyer, man
Bad bitches, I fly 'em in, fuck 'em

Still get the coke through the pipeline
Then off to the piper stem (Piper stem)
And I'm still getting paper back in rubber bands

You choked out for really thinkin' that this shit is a silly dream
When actually reality ain't what it really seem
And I ain't actin' on the scene, niggas scream
The actions ain't screened, just well-schemed
I'm tryna' have wealth for my well-being
By eighteen, pockets healthy green
What the fuck is twelve beans?
I need the cake and cream
The stakes is high like feens off a dream jet streaming
Having cuisines with the best seasonings
Its the vets season

I'm in Chi-raq and I'm getting blown like the breezes

Dead us, they just met us, but they won't forget us

You made a church out of feathers, so when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise
She like her Jesus mountain high
So He can watch her lonely child, I know my God
I know my God seen His breaks and His edges
Are jagged for giving that pain to His city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days He prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love

And we ain't even speaking English, body language will do
Punchanella and shoe
Need umbrella for you
Let’s play a game, try to make a hurricane in yo cooch
Hard to contain
Contain me when I’m hard and I’ll take apart your brains, pussy throbbing
Blood rushing through your arteries and veins
Now ain't that peachy now ain't that grapey
Let’s get some leafey and get to baking like Egyptians
Hieroglyphic lifted
Don’t believe in science fiction
But you see the pyramids so you believe somebody built them
I’m known for leaving stable women tilted
And I ain't eating in between her legs gefilte fishing
Nah really i’m just being silly
That’s what she like about a nigga though
Opera house, Figaro
You at the point in ya life
You realize, you've been lying to yourself, lying with the wrong guys
All these lions in the den got you looking at the sky
Like God why these lip lickers only looking at my thighs
Probably cause you on the internets, looking for some likes
What a waste of life
And I ain't here to judge
But what a waste of life
You do this all because you ain't getting enough love from your guy
But I...I...I..I can tell
There’s a lot more to you than them bathroom photo shoots
So...So...So..So.So gimme yo bones and I can give you my bones
And we can all turn to juice


Unless you’re asking for it
I don't wanna hurt you baby, unless you’re asking for it
I don't wanna hurt you baby, unless you’re asking for it

You the one I can't leave alone
You grown? I know you groan
When I'm in you, I feel home
We in the house of love, no lie
Appreciate you more as time goes by
When it's truly true, it don't die
I see you in L.A., I see you in N.Y
I see you in the A, I see you in the Chi
I hear you when JAY still make the song cry
Truthfully, I wanna rhyme like common sense
You the one that gave me that confidence
You the one that told me 'bout consciousness
And said see beyond my metropolis
You put the booga-booga loop, pop lockin' this

In my life, you've been vocal
But at times, I felt like I didn't know you
Now I know you had to grow too
And experience life so you can know you
We all change, for what it's worth
You an angel and still down to earth
In many ways you like my religion
When no one else did, to me you listen
Gangstas, gods, you hugged and kiss 'em
No matter, you stayed in my system
Your eyes glisten, you talk vision of partyin'
And gettin' people out of prison
Through the struggle you taught us to Nipsey Hussle
That's why we all love you

It's been hard to choose another girl
They trip when you mumble, they trip when you sing
But you gave us a chance to dream
In young thugs, you see a future
You recognize little uzi ain't here to shoot ya
At 21, you knew I was savage
But you said, ""Common, you will never be average""
It's a cold world, we need JAY
If you could dot com, you could dot K
You rock two chains, keep your mind free
You see a Malcolm X in a YG
You told me I'm the mane like Gucci
With a chance to rap and make movies
You gave mills to the meek, to inherit the Earth
Before me too, you said, ""Ladies first""
Things get rocky, you there ASAP
Rocky or Ferg, you there to swerve
I want you to get the love you deserve
My will made it on a mic' with words
With no name, I was a hard MC

Why don't you turning them floor shoes into some ho shoes, ya dig?

The good man in me say, ""Get money and stay on the path""
But the pimp shit in me say, ""Yo, keep looking for ass""
But my daughter gave me a gift, something to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snow
I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes
Better wait 'til you grown, when he love you, you'll know
Everybody's got a dream, a hopeful wish to own a six times two
Cylinder whip, a fantasy, a bone to pick
Revenge to get, against - who I don't know
Someone who said you won't blow, you won't eat, you won't cake
They mistake blaming me for they failures, I'm fresh, getting tailored
Single breasted, a lint brush is senseless, some pimp shit
A woman hates a man and stays with him for many years
Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him
Now lame is how the ghetto judge him, 'cause he still with her
She'll take his cash and give it to some other real nigga...

Ay pimping been going on man for eons and eons man since the beginning of time

So the only thing I gotta tell you man is you know
Do what you gotta do man
Bring my money back, get on that track and get on your back

I heard 'em say the NBA's a bunch of million-dollar slaves
A portea wasn't real back in the days, the point I make is
Jerry owns the Lakers, his yearly takings
Let's just say more than collectively all of his players
That's business, not really pimp shit
Maybe a tid-bit similar to when we rappers make big hits
And not own the masters, that's the deal
By the way, Poitier helps all the Denzels excel
He kept it more than real, but Hollywood can turn a girl out
I knew a girl 'bout, 5'9"", so fine, she could for sure grind
She was sleek, chic, with a classic mouth
Movie directors always fucked her on the casting couch
She came out with a blockbuster, can't knock a hustler
She not a hooker, she focused, a hopeless soul on a lonely road
I showed her all my stones and gold
I said ""Bitch, life is cold, you need to roll with a nigga""

A scared man a dead man, can I get a amen
You done bought all of them guns and ain't nobody dead yet
Catch your pussy ass in traffic, aim at the headrest
Got your bitch on her knees lookin' like she legless
Like I can't trust my iPhone, I can't trust the clique I ride for
If I see 'em in the streets I'ma have to treat 'em like a rival
I'm a pleasure to your eyeballs
I'm so fly I shop at Skymall
Mama never bought me knockoffs
Lord I need some wood to knock on
Lil Tunechi, I'm a movie, get your gummy bears and popcorn
I got somethin' very hot on my hip, I get my hip hop on
And this little red dot gon' help me hit a nigga spot on
Point guard with the bullets; you say Rájon, I say Rajon
Yeah, hold up; we them boys, we them wild boys
I hold a pistol sideways when I shoot, that's for style points
Menace to society, menace to myself though
Bend but don't break, my niggas call me elbow
And you don't want no problem, I'm a problem
My AK just keep shootin', it's on autopilot
Tunechi what's your fuckin' problem? I got fuckin' problems
Bad bitch on top of me, she started from the bottom
On that Cognac and that loud pack, that loud pack
You gotta shoot the rat when it get too big for the mousetrap
Shoot at me and I'ma smile back and then I'll ""Pow"" back

Made enough to quit but I keep makin' up excuses
Triple A dick, that's Amazin' And Amusin'

We don't give a fuck if they ass adopted

Soulja Slim, Pac, Pimp C, I hope they smilin'
And Weezy still hot as tamales
My private plane got that wi-fi and that wireless
I'm so sorry for the wait

Spread your legs, girl, I'm tryna break the headboard
I'm a fiend for the bread, I want the whole Dej Loaf
My Chinese chick just want a blunt and some yaka mein
She a squirter so we don't fuck on my Versace sheets
My whole crew'll skate on you like a hockey team
It's like Wayne Gretzky meets Jeremy Shockey
We Young Money Mafia, I rep what I rep
Try to throw salt on my name and I'll put pep in your step
Put your gloves on, nigga please get you a grip
And I bet you rest in peace when I let this bitch rip
The money runnin' like water, check the cash flow
My weed funky like armpits and assholes
Potato on the nine, when we creep we mash slow
And make sure them kids get everything they ask for
My bitch in London said she's a Mack Mainiac
And her sister love Tune, she a Wayniac
It's like she's two different persons; she be chillin', she be cursin'

Aw, shit! Yeah
You ready to get this shit started or what?
A'ight, well I brought some friends with me too

Now I ain't back just for the sake of just saying I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
Out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturin'
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin'
Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurrin'
Uh-oh! You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in trouble!
What's occurring befo', after, and during the show
Has no bearing on the bad news I'm bearing, whoa
What is it, wordplay? No, I'm pushing you out the do'
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fucking feet 'til you get to squishing a ho
It's pandemonium, standing o when you see him, oh
Damn baby you look good, you're giving me wood
You should pull over like a sweatshirt with a hood
It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm copping over this game to pinch a loaf
Now, homie, who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words, I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed, came back an hour after the accident
And bit a Goddamn Jawbreaker in half!
So stop faking the funk and start shaking your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap
And Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazing than that?
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?

I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy I'll fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the lining
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69ing
It's like Rick James is shooting up your house, nigga!
Fuck yo' couch, nigga!
You're screaming, ""Fuck the world!"" with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch know I'm perfectly fit for murder
Because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel to O.J. to Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear and ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neumann mad cerebral
You on your last burrito!
(What that mean Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eating
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on fire, nobody touching that
Good day and good night, Ortiz, yo, where the fuck you at?

I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years
Ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at, a nightmare
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art of my nice wear
It's type weird 'cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his ninth beer
Homie, chill, listen, I swear
I'm god, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be? Just waiting to be hooked to IV
As Mumm-Ra's well, when you look at my pee
And this joint (No exception), so just point (A direction)
And record the pig's oink (When I rip his intestines)
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what I exhibit
Seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Edimminem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgusting hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?

I'm right here letting the shotty pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winning
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches
Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flying
We do it to try to do without tryin'
(Slaughterhouse!) 'Cause to it's us it's so easy

Start over again
Everything happens for a reason

Ain't it funny how you're born and then your life begins
Just like a baby all alone, that's if you wasn't a twin
You must begin to fend for self when the umbilical's cut
The doctor put you under the heating lamp, your spirit is touched
You know what, I take that back, why? You was alive
Date of conception, interception cause the sperm did collide
From T 'n A to DNA, feelings turn to children
The morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existence
We livin, breathin, soon we'll be teethin
Our granny got a gold and now we want one for that reason
An adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages
But parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages
Cell therapists beware of this lugie that I spit

Little Ricky's home, he gotta serve probation for six months

Good doesn't come without pain
Meaning, before it get better, it's gon' get worse
Like my homies on the sick side still dyin over turf
That don't belong to urse; I mean us, left in the dust
Try to catch up with massah
I used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus
Of them crackers, but Ephesians 6:12
Said it wasn't flesh and blood that we wrestle against
Princ-ipalities, powers of this world
Rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness in high places
So throw on the whole armor of righteousness
I spark this thang, but my name ain't Bubba
I got a problem with racist cab drivers, like Glover
And brothers that wax fat and forget all about the struggle
Yeah, come on, come on, guess what, guess what
Time to reset this thang

Start over again (Uh, 2 triple zero, 2k ain't to dang old)

Listen to me, I awaken to sunlight
That's beyond bright; this day will be done right
There is a war just waitin' on the other side of the door
But I'll be bringing God to the gunfight
Can't live forever, so have some fun, right?
Life's a bowl of candy, you can have one, right?
You can handle if tomorrow never come, right?
You get used to singin', if only for one night
But I intend to raise two daughters and a son right
And I couldn't have wrote this if I was hopeless
And see I focus to provoke this
So open wide for my opinionated opus
Stop playin Go Fish, but not below this
Before I go, I thought that you all should know this
Recognize and realize before any regretting
Before you relapse, perhaps you'll consider resetting

I just wanna be a legend, every second I got to be going in
A part of me want to chill, but a part of me want to win
No college paying my bills, I'm saying just what it feels
Cause haters be looking stupid when you just keepin it real
I got too much on my mind to care about the internet bullshit
When the people coming up sayin I'm forgetting who I am just because they
Random dudes I went to school with
I'm cool with chillin with some buddha smoke
I always do it big like a Jewish nose
Cadillacs I'm trynna get a few of those

One day you gonna make it
If they gave you hand out, and you were down, babe, would you take it?
I found out being famous in reality, well it ain't shit
Cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand
But it don't mean a thing 'til you change it
Listen, baby, I'mma be great now
We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late
I'mma make my way to the top, every day I get closer
When I was young they told me to wait until I'm older
And turned a cold shoulder to me
And now they want tickets to my shows for free
Hey man, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?
Bitch suck my dick

Throwing moldy donut holes at your grody ho
From his cronies' whip
Eating like the kids when you take ‘em off Ritalin
Throwing temper tantrums at the window of your whip again
Sweeping up the glass to use it as a garnish over tacks
Damaged like the leg he limping to the barn with
Chickenshits
Temper 'bout as thick as tips of pencils is

Racquets you play tennis with, hated for bank lifting and
Spraying then hide away in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and filetted sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up

Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs

Or a swift fist off your chin from his wrist-launcher
Chick, chronic thrift shopper, thick like the Knicks roster
Stormed off and came straight back like pigs' posture
Pen? Naw, probably written with some used syringes
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch
Gooey writtens, scoot 'em to a ditch, chewed and booty-scented
Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms
Stupid, thought it up, jot it quick 
Thaw it out, toss it right back like a vodka fifth
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint
Then lob a wad of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit

Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out ""Jigga""
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, ""He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig""
But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib

Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?""
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother

Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, ""New Jack City""—got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
On that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me""
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way""

Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game

Or maybe she's the quiet type who's into heavy metal
Boy, you got to get it settled

She understands the things you're doin'
She's a modern woman
She looks sleek and she seems so professional
She's got a lot of confidence, it's easy to see
You want to make a move
But you feel so inferior
Cause under that exterior
Is someone who's free
She's got style and she's got her own money
So she's not another honey you can quickly disarm
She's got the eyes that make you realize
She won't be hypnotized by your usual charm

She says she loves you but she doesn't know why
In the morning she leaves you with your coffee and your paper
It's a strange situation for an old fashioned guy
But times have changed
Things are not the same, baby
You overcame such a bad attitude
Rock and roll just used to be for kicks
And nowadays it's politics
And after 1986 what else could be new

You got to learn to relax
And face the facts of modern woman

Yo, how do I keep
(Man, I don't know what’s up with these hoes, man)
Gettin' in relationships like this?
(I'm just sayin’)
Maybe it says somethin' about me
(Yeah, yup)
Should I look in the mirror?

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not 'til she gets her act together

She thinks I'm bein’ mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
She’s about to let the demons out
She don't wanna see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin’ to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how—

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
I guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein’ weird's normal

And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless
No wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger
She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over
Kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted
Up with someone so unlikable and shifty
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing
She's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
Into a motherfucking crime scene?
Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't s'posed to agree, you fucking bitch!
'Specially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceited cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!

I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hopin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognize me and had Milo flip me off
Right out the passenger side window (*Beep-beep*)
I hit a light pole, you skirt off
And then pull up at 5 a.m. in the drive in a stretched white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye, so shut your pie hole

Just wanna be normal

I'm just too old and set in my ways
I was convinced I would always be lonely
All of the rest of my days
Maybe I give up on romance
In my longing to give up the pain
I just didn't believe I would ever love again
I was like one who had shut myself in
Closed the windows, locked all the doors
Afraid of the dark and the beat of my heart
Yet knowing there had to be more
Though it sounds like a great contradiction
It's the easiest thing to explain
You see, I was afraid I might never love again
What does it take for a blind man to see
That there's more there than just meets the eye
What are the ways that the magic comes in
That can turn a song into a sigh
Sometimes I think that I'm dreaming
Or maybe I'm going insane
Or maybe it's just that I'm falling in love again

The coppers still shoot us down on Channel 5 news
Lock us up for anythin' we do to pay dues
Some of us woke while some stay snoozed
Zombies walkin’ around trippin' over issues
The knowledge is official but it's often misused
America my masseuse, massagin' my back
Tryna act like, she ain't gonna do me like Pratt
Geronimo, take a leap and lay flat
I'm down to go for my message to spread across the map
Holy cross on my back got a bullseye on it
I gotta get stoned to fulfill my moment
Oppress my oppressor, suppress the opponent
Channel my ancestor, he wouldn't condone it
In search of the healin' component
Said you would notice
If you took notice, but you too nosey
Time to wake up
Won’t you come and smell the hot coffee?
Stick your nose in the wrong places, one day you’ll OD
I swear the whole world owe me
I'm nothin’ close to the old me
If you never knew me, then it's too late to be homies
Homie, say fuck what you told me
I'm ridin' out by my lonely

Y'all already know what it is
(God don't make no mistakes)
(God don't make no mistakes)

Little do they know when I was brought up in this game
'Twan ain't always in a vibe for spitting, I made a change
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter
I wasn't ready to be no father, maybe, kinda, sorta
'Cause when I saw her, I swear it made a tear fall
Not tears of sorrow but of joy, so listen here y'all
I grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared, dog
Back in '94, that was the motherfucking year, homeboy
Then that Southernplayalistic went platinum
Stacks on deck, they ain't tell us to pay our taxes
Walking around the table in the kitchen just for practice
Reciting rhymes to sharpen mine, now let's deliver to the masses

It's been a good long road
Now its time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high

Welcome to my life, I think its time I take it back
I got to give you all the facts so you can see what type of cat
That you dealing with
Now on ATLiens, we was killing it
And then my auntie passed, she was like my mother, I was feeling it
The first person close to me to die, I needed healing
But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling
Like my daddy and granddaddy on both shoulders steady chilling
So you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning
It's your birthday, even on your worst day
Live it like the first day, I'm Antwan Andre
Or General Patton if you know 'bout Purple Ribbon or Got Purp
I, I be on that kryptonite, that means I can't be hurt
(Gotta leave this place it's been cool but I got to go...)

It's been a good long road
Now its time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high

Even on the train
Surely as truth remains
I'll be back again
(Know we been through a lot, and I ain't perfect
But I swear to you I'm a changed man)
Even on the train
Surely as truth remains
I'll be back again
(From the caboose)

And now it's time to say goodbye, they should've turned me loose
I was all about my team but now I call upon my crew
I'm a family type of person but I'm deadly dolo too
You can achieve anything that you put your heart into
See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock
The nigga Big still hit the stage by hisself and still rock
Cus when your faith is in the right place, see, he ain't gon' let you flop
You can say whatever you want (Bet you can't do it like me) Boy, stop!!

Before you say you can't hit goal
Please, no excuse this time, don't be afraid to fly
You never know what day the doors will close
It's time to say goodbye time to pack up and ride
Got to leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go
(I can take it from here, ladies; y'all done a good deed tonight)

Can you feel it?
Don't answer that, that was a rhetorical question
(Ahem) rhetorical (rhetorical)
(unhhh)

Forever life been never nice, we expedite the process
And every night I get advice, cause life is way too complex
Heaven's lights are hella bright, ironic how that came to be
But can't you see? This angel speaks
She's saying the place is safe for me
I told her ""wait for me,"" the make believer normally disguise
Transform before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs
The morning rises and I'm fast asleep
Somewhere off in the master suite
Having dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks
My mind, it wanders to places yonder and even farther
When I'm sleep walking I'm Stephen Jobs or I'm Peter Parker
A genius author, a Jesus preaching just to feed his daughter
The weed to spark up, yeah he's a goner, fuck these prima-donnas
I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings

I'm wearing a blindfold, like, ""Where did the time go?""
I know you hear me up there, give me a sign though
I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Baby, I'ma follow you wherever your mind go
Take me away, girl, somewhere they won’t be
Hold me closely, look at me, don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind go?
Said, will you follow me wherever my mind go?

I'm just trying to make it all make sense
As you hypothesize on how to monetize and take advantage of
All the time “we fall behind, get lost in this Aquarium
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria
Confessions that I have and curiosity about life and death
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest
Read about the meaning of dreaming and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes
We all in search for substance, that drugs you pain and numbness

I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this coming

Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days
Life, it works in such mysterious ways

I know you hear me up there, give me a sign though

And valleys, dilly-dallyin' 'round with the idea

I walk around the house tryna fight mirrors

You killed it!"" Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men

And the truth is, fame's startin' to give me an excuse
To be at an all-time low; I sit alone in my home theater
Watchin' the same damn DVD of the

And it hurts so I fast forward, sleeping pills'll make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I'll just take a couple more, yeah, you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound

Shit, it just hit me that what if I would not've made it through?
I think about the things I would'a never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together, hey
Wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain, when it rains
Guess it pours — yes, it does, wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers, Heaven knows I've never been a saint

Pass the herbs
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs
Had to learn, had to learn (had to learn)
We just had to burn, check

It all started with this special herb, then after that, it came to sexual words
I'm meeting shorty up to patch her a verse
She played Bonnie and I collide with a vibe when I'm inside her walls
I cut my shorties on the side cause I decide that she all
Mine's, I keep her in my eyes at all times
Not because I don't trust her I just, can't get enough of her
On the phone late until her mom dukes be cussing her
She played the hustler and I'm like mad customers
Man swear I'm in love and ain't afraid to admit it
Be blowing up her line, man I swear I'm addicted
But, it's all cool cause when in love, we all fools
They say men lie and women lay naked, that's all foolin'
Numbers don't matter after the first night
Right, so what the fuck is love at its first sight
If you ask me, another stupid analogy
Made to cover flaws in the female anatomy

But I'ma keep gradually telling these bitches
Don't front (don't front) don't front (don't front)
Don't front, don't front though (don't, don't, don't front)
I got some weed and some fronto (don't front)
And you know I always hunt hoes
I tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door
Now don't front (don't front) don't front (don't front)
Check (don't, don't, don't front)

It's like a massacre when mass occur
I got a massive urge but I had to learn
Heard you had it on lock so I pass the word
I stash the herb, sit back observe
That she make me feel good is all I ask of her
In the clouds, who would've known we would've crash and burn?
I prayed long and hard, hoping things will last with her
I ain't mad at her, but I really wish that it ain't have to hurt
Let's be blunt, we're best buds
Both knew our role this is more than just a crush
I used to pick her up longing for our lips to touch
But now I rarely even see her
In everybody, hood not even the law enforcement can keep up
She ain't want no one to know, so I kept it on the low
Any time that we would kick it, I make sure I had some toe
I thought I knew her better than anyone would know
Bagged her at her friends, but home were I would take her
Didn't know that she was a ho, that only wanted my paper
Whenever I was with her, my mind would just relax
Could've been the hot topic cause I swore we were a match and
I admit it girl you fine as hell
Don't know your perfume but you exert the finest smells
You tryna find her then follow her trail
She left a few old lovers inside of a jail, that's all a part of the tale

But I'ma keep gradually telling these bitches
Don't front (don't front) don't front (don't front)

Now don't front (don't front) don't front (don't front)
Check (don't, don't, don't front)

Ayo, don't tell me be patient with no doctor prescription
Emotionless positions and provocative visions
Should've known you missed a note like the octave was switching
Remember hate the game but she's spotting some glitches
It's a simulation yeah, stimulation
Take off your shirt, let me feel manipulative
My heart like the Himalayas, but yeah, I gotta slay her
I'm crushing on you sweetheart but yeah I'm a player
Sort of like Isaiah so baby let me coach you
And I know I'm not the first jerk to approach you
So, this ain't nothing new to you, nothing unusual
Nothing you ain't used to so my nothing is useable

We all try when you go bye, we all high
Truth is I'm never home and I'm cold if that's where the heart lies
So label me as heartless, it's not that I don't care
I just learned to use my heart less, gain sanity and lost stress
It put me in a state that just started taking a toll on me
Kept the secrets you told me, keep emotions I would hold beneath
Always kept the L so I know defeat
Said everything will feel much better soon as you know I leave
Not sure if it's the meds that made you think I'm mediocre
I was still body with a glove on, you know I'm cold, ma
I'm in animal pause, but you got an Ark
When it flooded, used to always feel like Noah

And I know I know her, had these kind of skills I had to show her
So I told her I'm the nigga she see on the posters
Came back through and I put it in the holster
Just had to teach her one time
Put it down, don't really give a fuck though (don't front)

Come here and smell the Folgers, the soldiers are human beings
Man actin as if he was the supreme bein
Clockin the souls of men out like he was G-O-D and
W-A-Rrah, there'll be no tomorrow but sorrow
And horror will follow the hollow hearts battle for dollars
Politicians, modern day magicians
Physicians of death, more health care for poor health
Who makin us ill, they makin us kill
That's makin me spill my guts (chill Big, lay in the cut)
For what? I refuse to sit in the backseat and get handled
Like I do nuttin all day but sit around watch the Cartoon Channel
I rap about, the Presidential election and the scandal
That followed, and we all watched the nation, as it swallowed
And chalked it up, basically America you got FUCKED
The media shucked and jived now we stuck - damn!

Was it full of bleeps and blunders, did they ever find Osama?
And why in the fuck did Daniel Pearl have to pay the price

To dampen the dream of all the Panthers
They got they answer for ransom

The illest Hennessy Black sipper with loaded semis

It was free, it was easy to steal because no
Sister would miss it really
Why would anyone steal it anyway?
You can apply it with the same expertise
As you have with your guitar
Just a bit so no one
Gets too in your face
Hit the street and go look for Angela
Licking Angela's thighs back and round and round
Black lined lashes is punk rock sex
Without all the hangups
Hits are for squares
And so is money
Burnt English muffin crunches nicely between teeth
With still a whole lotta future to go
Bags of records as currency
For rent and cigs and electricity
Shit and phone, prostitutes
On Chrystie and Delancey
Think I can afford sex
In Sara Delano Roosevelt Park?
Maybe I look like a rich kid
Or at least some kid with a bit of coin
They will take it
I can't even imagine it
Nowhere to go but the back door
Hard boot kick to metal void
Cold beer stench
Speed plowed waitress
Some art rock types working our way
To ice cream and thin sheet glory
A smile on the Jesus freak
Hooked on our show
Burnished hearts blind to
Inevitable madness
Take care of the devil
Treat him with embrace
Alive with Mary Magdalene's heart
Her eyes light the screen, a siren
Breasts somewhat buttoned
Somewhat busting through
Next town over and I land into
Exasperated non-finish
Deliver me into tour mode
Fucking kids crashing through the woods
Stream language, resilient nature
Ripping through stones, rocks
Fallen branch
The chattering skulls of adult nayspeak
Dead orange alerts annoy the bedroom gate
The poems, like text-straps, soothe and protect
And beautify the insect click
City noise, screeching car-things
Grandmothers in fractured finery
A perfect day to taste a dog's coat
Puppy lust and luck
Corrective licking strategies
She motions for a light curious
To the invasive fix

What you want from me?
I can see little inclinations, look like invitations
More low-key with my natural nature
I will be all on that in like three seconds

I oblige, I don't do the Obi-Wan
Never have to force facts, the vibe in the room as thick as a short stack
Still I don't make a move until shorty endorse that
Only portions 'til she releasin' endorphins
I need you speakin' case I'm tweakin' and just seein' distortions

Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon' put it in reverse

Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—

Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
But witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didn't kill him; in fact, it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
